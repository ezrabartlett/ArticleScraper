Well cast and twisty, it's an earnest if mostly undistinguished effort, one that relies heavily on the one-time Avenger's star power in serving its mission to bring viewers to Apple TV+. <br><br>Evans flexes different acting muscles as Andy Barber, an assistant district attorney who is introduced in court, looking like a broken man. The narrative then flashes back 10 months, to happier times with his wife Laurie (Michelle Dockery) and their 14-year-old son Jacob (\"It's\" Jaeden Martell), before one of his classmates turns up murdered. <br><br>Andy is assigned the case, which he begins to investigate despite the somewhat uncomfortable proximity of his kid to the event. That all changes when Jacob becomes the prime suspect, leading to a trial, unsettling revelations about his son and all the media scrutiny that goes with being swept up in a high-profile crime. <br><br>Andy's experience and relationships obviously create discomfort as he joins the fray, telling Jacob, \"There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.\" But Laurie's faith seems shakier, especially as new information keeps dribbling out, making them wonder if they know their child as well as they think. <br><br>Adapted by writer Mark Bomback and Norwegian director Morten Tyldum from the 2012 book, \"Defending Jacob\" features inordinately good actors in smallish roles, including J.K. Simmons as Andy's estranged father -- in prison for murder, making people wonder if the apple skipped a generation in falling from the tree -- Cherry Jones as Jacob's defense attorney, and Pablo Schreiber as Andy's colleague now tasked with prosecuting the case. <br><br>Still, not all the wrinkles add up especially well, the story feels awfully familiar -- limited-series mysteries about murdered teens have been a pretty well-traveled road since \"The Killing\" -- and the courtroom action bogs down a bit during the later stages. <br><br>Evans, who also wears a producer's hat, is quite good, if perhaps a little distracting (that's one very physically fit D.A.) every time he's shown around the house in a T-shirt. <br><br>The main source of frustration is that the story, purposefully, provides so little sense of the accused -- an approach intended to evoke uncertainty among the audience as well as his parents, which has the perhaps unintended effect of blunting the drama. <br><br>Apple continues to feel its way in this new programming arena, and as premium TV goes, aligning yourself with big names is seldom a bad way to go in meeting one key goal -- namely, garnering attention. <br><br>\"You can be a good man, or you can be a good father,\" Andy is told at one point. <br><br>\"Defending Jacob\" doesn't face that daunting choice, but it is, at best, just a pretty good miniseries. <br><br>\"Defending Jacob\" premieres April 24 on Apple TV+. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}, {"id": "7", "title": "Ricky Gervais' 'After Life' loses something the second time around"}, {"id": "9", "title": "Chris Hemsworth kills a lot more than time in Netflix's 'Extraction'"}, {"id": "25", "title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits"}]}, "3": {"title": "What the cast of 'Too Hot To Handle' has been up to since filming", "content": "Netflix's latest dating show, \"Too Hot To Handle,\" invited sexy singles to hang out on the beach with a twist -- no sexual contact for any of the contestants.  <br><br>Although the show recently debuted on the streaming service, it was filmed a year ago, so all the men and women who participated have been back in their real lives for some time now.  <br><br>Here's where they are: <br><br>David Birtwistle is a fitness and nutrition coach who lives in London and has his own company.

As a consequence, the second six-episode run feels as if it's essentially retracing old territory -- moving in places, but with less urgency, and more prone to silly detours to flesh out the run. <br><br>Gervais' formula of two seasons and out (plus a follow-up special) worked well enough for the original \"The Office\" and \"Extras.\" But his filmography has been more uneven of late, with \"After Life\" very much in keeping with the writer-producer-star's outspoken atheism and darker, if not irredeemable view of life. <br><br>As a brief recap, the first season found Gervais' Tony sleepwalking through his days after his beloved wife died of cancer, consoling himself by watching old videos and home movies, with a faithful dog (Eho's a good girl? You are) as a companion. <br><br>By the end, Tony's outlook had brightened, showing traces of generosity toward coworkers at the local newspaper where he grudgingly churned out human-interest stories, and finding a potential new romance in the nurse, Emma (Ashley Jensen, splendid as always), looking after his dementia-stricken dad (David Bradley). <br><br>The new season, however, finds Tony backsliding, again wallowing in grief to the point of endangering his relationship with Emma, who understandably struggles with his behavior. This continues, notably, despite the advice that Tony seems intent on ignoring from his cemetery pal Anne (Penelope Wilton), who chides him not to mess things up. <br><br>In the most uncomfortable real-life echo, the aforementioned newspaper is struggling financially -- at a moment when that industry is painfully unraveling -- posing an additional challenge to Tony's boss and brother-in-law, Matt (Tom Basden), whose marriage is falling apart even as he presides over the paper's woes. <br><br>From there, though, Gervais keeps veering into the semi-absurd, with over-the-top subplots such as Matt's sessions with an abusively self-absorbed therapist, who spends way more time talking about himself; and Tony's bizarre mail carrier (Joe Wilkinson), who doesn't respect conventional boundaries. <br><br>Granted, Gervais' material has always oscillated between the poignant and outlandishly quirky characters, and as his Golden Globe hosting stints suggest, he has embraced being a provocateur. That said, the gags don't feel nearly as fresh as, say, the first-season bit that involved Tony hiring a prostitute (Roisin Conaty) because he was too listless to clean his flat. <br><br>Conceptually, it's hard not to admire the audacity of building what's ostensibly a comedy around crippling depression, featuring a protagonist who finds no comfort from religion or any of the usual balms used to provide comfort and ease such pain. <br><br>Even so, the balance feels a bit off in this latest go-round. And while \"After Life\" eventually reaches a relatively satisfying place, the show meanders -- lost in a sort of narrative purgatory -- longer than it should in getting there. <br><br>\"After Life\" begins its second season April 24 on Netflix. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "9", "title": "Chris Hemsworth kills a lot more than time in Netflix's 'Extraction'"}, {"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "2", "title": "Chris Evans flexes different muscles in the Apple TV+ miniseries 'Defending Jacob'"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}, {"id": "60", "title": "Washington Post: Trump administration official in charge of coronavirus testing was forced out of vaccine research job"}]}, "9": {"title": "Chris Hemsworth kills a lot more than time in Netflix's 'Extraction'", "content": "Far more interested in stunts than story, \"Extraction\" is a simple-minded action vehicle for Chris Hemsworth that should benefit from providing a theatrical-style adrenaline rush when the spigot for such fare has closed. Basically, Netflix is serving up an old-fashioned B movie, at a moment when the A-list blockbusters have been postponed. <br><br>The \"Thor\" star reunites with \"Avengers\" directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who produced the film, with Joe writing the script. Sam Hargrave, a second-unit director and stuntman on the \"Avengers\" movies (he doubled for Chris Evans), also makes his feature directing debut, which explains the emphasis on visceral thrills and can-you-top-this stunts. <br><br>The centerpiece of that is a bracing action sequence shot as one continuous scene, which would be more impressive, frankly, if \"1917\" hadn't done the whole thing longer and better. Still, if the goal is to show off a bit in terms of technical expertise, it's certainly a way of hammering the point home. <br><br>Beyond that, \"Extraction\" is a pretty numbing affair, reminiscent of early Arnold Schwarzenegger movies (\"Commando\" comes to mind), with a pinch of \"Man on Fire.\" It's the sort of movie where bodies pile up promiscuously, and the near-unstoppable protagonist takes a grilling and keeps on killing. <br><br>In this case, in one of the oldest cliches imaginable, Hemsworth's Tyler Rake is a battle-scarred mercenary nursing a wounded soul because of a personal loss. \"You're hoping if you spin the chamber enough times, you're going to catch a bullet,\" a colleague tells him, indicating that he really doesn't care if he lives or dies. <br><br>Rake is enlisted to extract Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of a jailed drug lord, who is abducted by a rival boss, Amir (Priyanshu Painyuli), and taken to Bangladesh. With the city under Amir's control, Rake must fight off enemies at every turn, gradually bonding with the kid along the way. (\"Stranger Things'\" David Harbour pops in, briefly, as an old ally.) <br><br>Surviving will mean fighting through hordes of faceless attackers, dispatching many by shooting them at point-blank range. There's a kinetic quality to the action, but setting aside that aforementioned tracking shot, nothing action fans haven't seen in, say, the Jason Bourne movies, which weren't quite as stingy in terms of plot. <br><br>For Hemsworth, whose recent credits include playing another military man in \"12 Strong,\" it's a perfectly adequate showcase, as he joins the roster of relentless warriors who speak a little and shoot, punch and stab a whole lot. As for the Russos, they seem to have taken a step back from huge spectacles, producing this after \"21 Bridges,\" a formula thriller designed for another Marvel star, Chadwick Boseman. <br><br>Netflix's movie ambitions have meant producing a variety of genres -- courting awards with some of its fare but also catering to teens and delivering the occasional action movie, such as the recent Ryan Reynolds-Michael Bay team-up \"6 Underground,\" another bigger-budget effort with more brawn than brains. <br><br>Even without his hammer, Hemsworth still conjures a few sparks. But with apologies to his last collaboration with the Russos, \"Extraction\" feels like the short end of the stick. <br><br>\"Extraction\" premieres April 24 on Netflix. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "7", "title": "Ricky Gervais' 'After Life' loses something the second time around"}, {"id": "29", "title": "'Run' turns the lure of escaping by reconnecting with an ex into an HBO series"}, {"id": "25", "title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}]}, "11": {"title": "Clive Davis producing Whitney Houston biopic", "content": "The story of one of the biggest music stars of our time is coming to the big screen.  <br><br>Clive Davis and Pat Houston, on behalf of Whitney Houston's estate, are on board to produce a film currently titled \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody,\" the story of singer Whitney Houston.  <br><br>The film, which will track her story from her musical beginnings through her tragic death, will be a \"joyous, emotional and heart-breaking celebration of the life and music of the greatest female R&B pop vocalist of all time,\" according to a press release for the project.  <br><br>Stella Meghie, whose credits include 2020's \"The Photograph,\" is in \"advanced talks\" to direct, according to the release.  <br><br>Academy Award-nominee Anthony McCarten, who wrote other real life-based films like \"The Theory of Everything,\" \"Darkest Hour\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" will write the script.  <br><br>\"From all my personal and professional experience with Whitney from her late teenage years to her tragic premature death, I know the full Whitney Houston story has not yet been told,\" Davis, a veteran record producer and Houston's long-time collaborator, said in a statement. \"I am so glad that Anthony McCarten has committed to a no holds barred, musically rich screenplay that finally reveals the whole Whitney whose vocal genius deeply affected the world while she fiercely battled the demons that were to be her undoing.\"  <br><br>Houston died in 2012 of from an accidental drowning at age 48.

Built around a game of cat and mouse between an office-bound MI6 investigator and a mercurial assassin, it continues to offer darkly amusing moments thanks to its splendid cast, but at this point, the main thing the show seems to be killing is time. <br><br>BBC America and AMC (sister networks that share the show) moved up the premiere by two weeks, capitalizing on an audience hungry for content while filling the void left by \"The Walking Dead\" ending prematurely and a planned spinoff being delayed. <br><br>Still, as welcome as the show is as a globetrotting escape, its principal appeal -- pitting the aforementioned analyst, Eve (Sandra Oh), against the ruthless Villanelle (Jodie Comer) -- is blunted by having them apart, with the latter having shot Eve in season two and believing her dead. <br><br>Gradually, of course, their paths will cross again, but most of the early hours see them operating along separate tracks, with Eve trying to get her life back together, and Villanelle reconnecting with a former mentor (Harriet Walter). Among other things, Villanelle discovers that serving in a management capacity doesn't exactly suit her particular talents. <br><br>While there are good moments featuring other cast members -- including Kim Bodnia as Villanelle's handler and Fiona Shaw as Eve's one-time boss, grizzled veterans of the spy game -- there's simply no replacing the strange chemistry between the two leads that initially gave the show such a twisty, clever and sexually charged hook. <br><br>Series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has passed the show-running baton to new writers in each of the successive seasons (Suzanne Heathcote takes over this year), which has only underscored how her quirky, distinctive voice is difficult to replicate.  <br><br>There are some inspired visual gags, among them Villanelle carrying out an assignment in a clown outfit, or getting hiccups at an inopportune moment. The show does start coming into sharper focus eventually, but with an eight-episode season, those beats are late in the game. <br><br>All told, the series remains entertaining but increasingly feels like a pale version of its original self. The surprises owing to Villanelle's murderous nature have perhaps inevitably become less surprising, which might explain why the show feels as if it's in a bit of a rut.  <br><br>\"It's all about choices,\" Eve is told in the fourth of the five episodes previewed, and that's good advice. But the one choice that would likely restore \"Killing Eve\" to its early must-see status would be to announce that the fourth season -- which has already been ordered -- will be the last, conjuring a sense of urgency that the show, alas, now conspicuously lacks. <br><br>\"Killing Eve\" returns April 12 at 9 p.m. on BBC America and AMC. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "25", "title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits"}, {"id": "2", "title": "Chris Evans flexes different muscles in the Apple TV+ miniseries 'Defending Jacob'"}, {"id": "143", "title": "A shipwreck uncovered by waves every 20 or so years has been dated to pre-Revolutionary War times "}, {"id": "29", "title": "'Run' turns the lure of escaping by reconnecting with an ex into an HBO series"}]}, "25": {"title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits", "content": "Several weeks into the TV-produced-from-home phenomenon, a few things are becoming clear: The closer a show's format is to a couple of people talking, the better it generally fares in this environment, while others don't translate nearly as well. <br><br>Late night talk shows have adapted the most seamlessly, in what feels like a throwback to earlier days of broadcasting, which relied on pioneers like Jack Paar and Steve Allen to hold the viewer's attention minus any modern frills. <br><br>Granted, the hosts have missed having audiences and the energy they derive from appreciative laughter, but they've been broadly effective. <br><br>In some cases, the conversations in venues like \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" -- where the host's dog has become an occasional co-star -- even feel more intimate and relaxed, like being privy to a private chat between two famous people than the usual appearance. That might be due, in part, to the fact there's less promotion involved, since shilling for upcoming movies or TV shows feels like a little awkward. <br><br>The at-home approach is also compelling the hosts to reveal more of themselves -- and their families. The same goes for guests, such as Jason Bateman's young daughter essentially photo-bombing him this week during \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" <br><br>\"You can't really do anything that fake. It's really you,\" \"The Tonight Show's\" Jimmy Fallon said during an MSNBC interview on Tuesday. \"It's showing your real character. ... It's bizarre, but this is the times we're living in.\" <br><br>John Oliver's HBO show \"Last Week Tonight\" has weathered the shift almost without missing a beat, while working the new minimalism into the comedy. Bill Maher, by contrast, has essentially traded in his panel for individual interviews, while continuing to provide staples like \"New Rules\" and using clips of laughing audiences as a garnish to his monologue. <br><br>Music has also proved to be a natural, deeply personal vehicle for offering what amounts to acoustic shows. That will include the \"One World: Together at Home\" concert on April 18, which will play on multiple networks, featuring an eclectic roster of artists to raise funds intended to address the needs unleashed by Covid-19. <br><br>At the same time, there are obvious limits. \"Saturday Night Live\" deserves credit for the inventive nature of its \"at home\" experiment, but the revolving solo-shtick approach to sketch comedy began to feel almost oppressive and more than a little claustrophobic. Granted, \"SNL\" is often a trifle flabby, but 90 minutes of that felt like more than the exercise could reasonably sustain. <br><br>Similarly, ESPN's stunt with a remote \"HORSE\" competition -- the one-on-one basketball game built around trick shots -- was amusing for all of about 10 minutes, at which point the novelty and technical limitations began to take its toll. Yes, everyone is hungry for live sports, but after watching that, there's something to be said for those NBA Playoff reruns after all. <br><br>As it stands, one of the more creative efforts thus far has been \"Sesame Street: Elmo's Playdate,\" a star-studded special that played on HBO. Then again, that ran slightly less than 30 minutes, and puppets don't have to worry about social distancing.   <br><br>Everyone deserves to be cut slack as they find their way through this unprecedented period. But the lessons that programmers are learning now should inform what they're doing not only in the near term, but over the long haul, especially with the likelihood that social-distancing methods will be necessary, off and on, for an extended stretch. <br><br>That said, watching a lot of these programs in a week has somehow simultaneously stoked admiration for those soldiering on and made one yearn for TV like they used to make it way back in February of 2020 -- as loud, gaudy and filled with the sound of actual human laughter and applause as you can get. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}, {"id": "54", "title": "Why Elon Musk's Starlink satellites are upsetting stargazers -- again"}, {"id": "84", "title": "US may have to endure social distancing until 2022 if no vaccine is quickly found, scientists predict"}, {"id": "229", "title": "First on CNN: Flight attendant union wants leisure travelers to stay grounded"}]}, "27": {"title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good", "content": "Based on its business model, Quibi -- designed to be an \"on the go\" streaming service that you can watch in quick bites (hence the name) on your phone -- has seemingly had bad luck in the timing of its launch, with most of the world sheltering at home. But sampling its lineup, a more controllable flaw is that the shows generally aren't very good, which -- for a programming venture -- is more than a mere quibble. <br><br>Although the highest-profile fare includes \"Movies in chapters\" -- slicing dramatic stories into 7-to-9-minute sections as \"episodes\" -- the titles that work best are unscripted, which feels more suited to snack-sized video consumption. <br><br>As for any coherence to the selections, there really isn't any. Seemingly emulating Netflix, Quibi -- which is kicking off with a 90-day free trial -- appears to want to be some things to all people, delivering a hodgepodge of ideas ultimately defined more by the format than its content. <br><br>Quibi made more than two dozen individual offerings available to preview, so depending on personal preferences and interests your mileage might vary. That includes self-help fare, cooking shows, a revival of \"Punk'd\" (with Chance the Rapper) and news, sports, entertainment and latenight compilations, the last group basically approximating what you can see on those screens offering clips at the gas station. <br><br>There's utility in that, although it's tough to envision a true test of Quibi's value until life returns to semblance of normalcy, with people moving about and having small windows of time to fill while they wait in lines and the like. <br><br>For now, here's a breakdown of the more and least promising of Quibi titles, with an emphasis on the scripted shows, while flagging the higher-profile documentary or reality concepts. Based on first impressions, the service might have a few keepers in the latter bucket, but should consider going back to the drawing board with the former: <br><br>\"Most Dangerous Game\" <br><br>Perhaps the most watchable of the scripted shows, it's also the most familiar: Liam Hemsworth plays a former track star with a terminal illness, recruited by an oily Christoph Waltz to allow himself to be hunted as prey by unidentified players. The longer he survives -- a process yet to begin in the previewed episodes -- the more money he leaves to his family. Not bad, if only to listen to Waltz laying out the elaborate rules. <br><br>\"Flipped\" <br><br>The tired premise has Will Forte and Kaitlin Olson (\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") as a clueless couple who use stacks of money they literally find to finance their dream of hosting a home-remodeling show. But the cash, of course, belongs to a drug cartel. The show comes from Funny or Die, but the execution hews toward the latter. <br><br>\"When the Streetlights Go On\" <br><br>A murder sets this teen-oriented mystery into motion, which basically plays like a pale imitation of \"Riverdale.\" Or not. It's frankly hard to tell much based on what's available, which doesn't bode well. <br><br>\"Chrissy's Court\" <br><br>Chrissy Teigen presides over these \"People's Court\"-type small-claims disputes, with her mom serving as her bailiff. Teigen is good company, but the show is as weightless as a judge's robe. <br><br>\"Thanks a Million\" <br><br>A \"Queen for a Day\"-type concept in which celebrities -- starting with executive producer Jennifer Lopez -- hand out $100,000 to people they deem deserving, who must then pay half forward to someone else. It's certainly a feel-good show, but not especially well-served by cramming each heartwarming story into such a small package. <br><br>\"I Promise\" <br><br>In this docu-series, basketball star LeBron James has funded a public school for kids in need of extra assistance, another show with an uplifting aspect to it. <br><br>\"Gone Mental With Lior\" <br><br>Mentalist Lior Suchard dazzles different celebrities with his mind tricks in each of the episodes. While the format is nothing new, the show probably works better in terms of Quibi's format than anything else in its opening slate. <br><br>\"Survive\"  <br><br>Easily the worst thing in the Quibi arsenal, this utterly ill-conceived show stars \"Game of Thrones'\" Sophie Turner as a suicidal young woman who -- after that cheery introduction -- is on a flight that crashes in the middle of nowhere. She's left with a fellow passenger (Corey Hawkins) to try to survive if, you know, she actually wants to. <br><br>\"Memory Hole\" <br><br>Will Arnett hosts a nostalgic look back at pop-culture past, in another slim but decent time-killing exercise. <br><br>\"Murder House Flip\" <br><br>A weak addition to the home-renovation genre, here with an expert team (Mikel Welch and Joelle Uzyel) working to fix up houses that, yes, were once the scene of horrific murders. So basically your average true-crime show meets HGTV. <br><br>\"Nikki Fre$h\" <br><br>Nicole Richie tries her hand at rapping in this vanity project that doesn't come close to explaining why it exists and also features her family. A dreary effort that merely demonstrates just how long six minutes can seem when they're devoted to something this tedious. <br><br>Quibi launches on April 6. The service will cost $4.99 with ads, and $7.99 without them. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "25", "title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}, {"id": "9", "title": "Chris Hemsworth kills a lot more than time in Netflix's 'Extraction'"}, {"id": "54", "title": "Why Elon Musk's Starlink satellites are upsetting stargazers -- again"}, {"id": "29", "title": "'Run' turns the lure of escaping by reconnecting with an ex into an HBO series"}]}, "29": {"title": "'Run' turns the lure of escaping by reconnecting with an ex into an HBO series", "content": "\"Run\" begins with a premise that invites a ton of questions, then proceeds to answer them in mostly unsatisfying ways. Despite a creative pedigree that includes the Emmy-winning \"Fleabag's\" Phoebe Waller-Bridge and the romantic pairing of Domhnall Gleeson and Merritt Wever, this HBO series feels like one of those ideas that's going nowhere fast. <br><br>The opening is certainly promising: Wever's Ruby sits looking glum in a Target parking lot, when she receives a one-word text message: \"RUN.\" After some hesitation, she responds in kind. <br><br>The text came from Billy (Gleeson), Ruby's college ex, with whom she made a pact 17 years earlier: That if they both agreed, they would drop everything and reunite. <br><br>Paired with Issa Rae's \"Insecure,\" \"Run\" gets points for the undercurrent of 30-something angst into which it taps -- the sense that the roads taken don't always pan out as planned, and the lure of escaping into the relative freedom provided by the heady romances of our college years. It's the TV series version of hunting down an old flame via Facebook, taken to absurd and darkly comic extremes. <br><br>But what about everything that's happened in between -- the commitments left behind? Those facts and complications dribble out, too slowly, as the two embark on a cross-country trek by train, in a way that really doesn't do much to endear the audience to either of them. <br><br>Created by Waller-Bridge's longtime collaborator Vicky Jones (a veteran of both \"Fleabag\" and \"Killing Eve\"), there's a strong whiff of romance in the concept, and, amid their dodging and weaving, a fair amount of chemistry between the leads. \"Is anybody totally honest?\" Billy asks, clearly implying that would be a big fat \"no.\" <br><br>Still, with its cheeky indie-film sensibility, \"Run\" increasingly feels like it's straining to tease all this out. Good actors (among them \"The Good Wife's\" Archie Panjabi and \"Mad Men's\" Rich Sommer) keep popping up in smallish roles, but it's really a two-character piece -- and a somewhat claustrophobic one at that. <br><br>The show's dark streak (a Waller-Bridge hallmark) also manifests itself in the escalating situations, suggesting that Ruby and Billy won't be able to get through this experiment without causing collateral damage. That raises the stakes, but also adds hurdles to the already thorny issue of whether you really care what happens to these two, separately or together. <br><br>Mostly, \"Run\" is notable as a juicy vehicle for two topnotch performers, and to that extent, it's nice to see Wever (the \"Nurse Jackie\" alum who graduated to lead status in \"Unbelievable\") and Gleeson (a veteran of \"Ex Machina\" and the recent \"Star Wars\" trilogy) showcased in a different way. <br><br>Yet at the risk of being totally honest, after watching five episodes, it's a show that appears fated to run out of gas before this train ever reaches its destination. <br><br>\"Run\" premieres April 12 at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.

There are bad bosses, and then there are those for whom failure truly isn't an option. <br><br>As always, though, there are complications, perhaps the foremost being that the central couple differs regarding what's best for the business, each bringing his and her special brand of ruthlessness to the problem. <br><br>In one particularly brilliant wrinkle, each tries to pay off their marriage counselor in order to bend her toward their side, a game the psychologist (Marylouise Burke) is hilariously willing to play. <br><br>The season's other major thread involves Wendy's brother, Ben (Tom Pelphrey), a somewhat lost soul who finds a place with them. Still, not everyone is cut out for this life, even though Ben forges a relationship with Marty's tough-as-nails right hand Ruth (Julia Garner), who eventually begins to question the Byrdes' loyalty to her. <br><br>Finally, there's the drug kingpin's attorney, Helen (British actress Janet McTeer), who serves as his eyes in the US; and an FBI agent (Jessica Frances Dukes) on Marty's tail, engaging him in a rather elaborate game of cat and mouse. <br><br>Like \"Breaking Bad,\" \"Ozark\" keeps writing its characters into seemingly impossible corners, only to find plausible ways out. What this season really does, though, is drill down into the relationship between Marty and Wendy, who shows off her steely side in a conversation with her brother, where she discusses how \"fighting for your life\" expands the scope of one's capabilities. <br><br>The bottom line is that Marty, Wendy and their increasingly involved kids (Sofia Hublitz, Skylar Gaertner) have grown more accustomed to being thrust into perilous situations, dealing as they are with people who think nothing of leaving bodies strewn about when they don't get their way. And viewers are watching them gradually harden before our eyes. <br><br>When it premiered, \"Ozark\" felt like a solid addition to a rather saturated genre of ordinary folk taking walks on the wild side. Three seasons in, the show has morphed into something richer than that, mixing criminal ruthlessness with a family dynamic built on manipulation. <br><br>That might not be a life for everyone, but by now it is, clearly, for the Byrdes. <br><br>\"Ozark\" begins its third season March 27 on Netflix. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "25", "title": "Social distancing TV is finding its groove -- and discovering its limits"}, {"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "9", "title": "Chris Hemsworth kills a lot more than time in Netflix's 'Extraction'"}, {"id": "7", "title": "Ricky Gervais' 'After Life' loses something the second time around"}, {"id": "84", "title": "US may have to endure social distancing until 2022 if no vaccine is quickly found, scientists predict"}]}, "35": {"title": "Giant asteroid flying by Earth next week looks like it's wearing a face mask", "content": "An asteroid estimated to be 1.2 miles wide will fly by Earth next week, but it's not expected to collide with our planet.  <br><br>And if an asteroid could be aware of such things, it appears to be wearing a face mask in deference to the pandemic, according to new images from Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  <br><br>The asteroid is called 52768 (1998 OR2), and it was first spotted in 1998.  <br><br>On April 29, it will pass within 3,908,791 miles of Earth, moving at 19,461 miles per hour.

The devices are now coasting through orbit, where they will soon begin climbing to about 340 miles above ground, their operational altitude. This launch brings the total number of Starlink satellites in orbit to more than 400. <br><br>SpaceX has said the satellites will allow it to beam Internet directly to terminals that consumers will set up at their homes or offices. Service is expected to roll out in the United States and Canada this year, CEO Elon Musk has said. The company plans to eventually grow its constellation to more than 40,000 satellites, blanketing the entire planet in cheap, high-speed Internet connectivity.  <br><br>If Starlink is successful, it could bring in billions of dollars of new revenue for SpaceX, Musk has predicted. But there's still a lot to prove: rolling out a reliable service and offering it at price points that make sense for consumers is something tech firms have tried and failed to do in decades past.  <br><br>Last month, one of SpaceX's well-funded competitors, Softbank-backed OneWeb, filed for bankruptcy. The company lagged far behind SpaceX in deploying its constellation of internet satellites, and it had been struggling financially even before the Covid-19 pandemic dashed its efforts to secure new financing. <br><br>SpaceX and the broader US space industry have been designated \"critical infrastructure\" by the federal government, allowing much of their business operations to continue amid the global health crisis, even as stay-at-home orders have shuttered other industries. <br><br>SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment about its work during the pandemic. <br><br>The company has launched three Starlink missions so far in 2020. SpaceX also is preparing for its first-ever crewed mission next month. Two NASA astronauts will fly aboard a SpaceX rocket and capsule on a historic mission to the International Space Station on May 27, the space agency announced last week. <br><br>SpaceX was forced to delay the launch of a satellite for Argentina's space agency last month due to travel restrictions related to the pandemic. The company was also scheduled to launch next-generation GPS satellites for the US military this month, but the US Space and Missile Systems Center determined that launch could wait, citing Covid-19 concerns.  <br><br>The 45th Space Wing, an arm of the US military that oversees missions from the Florida space hub, says it is determined to get as many rockets off the ground as possible to ensure the space industry doesn't collect a long backlog of launches.  <br><br>Brigadier General Doug Schiess, the 45th Space Wing's commander, said it is still evaluating launches on a case-by-case basis to ensure the safety of government workers required to be on site to provide weather monitoring and other services during launches.   <br><br>About 200 government workers were needed to support the Starlink mission, Schiess said \u2014 about 100 fewer than required for other types of missions. That's largely because SpaceX's Falcon 9 is equipped with an abort system that automatically destroys the rocket if it goes off course in order to prevent damage to infrastructure, Scheiss said. That eliminates the need for some government staff that would otherwise have to monitor the mission.  <br><br>The 45th Space Wing will also help oversee SpaceX's crewed mission. That historic mission will mark the first time NASA astronauts have launched into space from US soil since the space shuttle program was retired in 2011. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "54", "title": "Why Elon Musk's Starlink satellites are upsetting stargazers -- again"}, {"id": "70", "title": "NASA to launch astronauts to space station from US soil for the first time in a decade"}, {"id": "43", "title": "US assesses Iran successfully launched a military satellite for the first time"}, {"id": "229", "title": "First on CNN: Flight attendant union wants leisure travelers to stay grounded"}, {"id": "186", "title": "United's unusual plan to sell $1 billion of stock"}]}, "49": {"title": "In photos: Love during lockdown", "content": "vel coronavirus has ended lives and upended lives, with new cases of Covid-19 being reported in places around the world each day.

The Milky Way's outer halo also contains much of the galaxy's mass.   <br><br>This new finding challenges the commonly held notions of how star systems have formed and evolved over billions of years.  <br><br>Using \"hyper-realistic\" computer simulations from the FIRE 2 project (Feedback in Realistic Environments 2), the scientists modeled the disruptions in galactic rotations that would otherwise be considered orderly. <br><br>\"The FIRE-2 simulations allow us to generate movies that make it seem as though you're observing a real galaxy,\" lead author Sijie Yu, a UCI doctoral candidate in physics, explained.  <br><br>According to researchers, the simulations suggest that the Milky Way has been thrusting stars, which is triggered by the powerful supernova explosions. <br><br>\"These highly accurate numerical simulations have shown us that it's likely the Milky Way has been launching stars in circumgalactic space in outflows triggered by supernova explosions,\" study author James Bullock said in a statement. Bullock is dean of UCI's School of Physical Sciences and a professor of physics and astronomy.  <br><br>\"It's fascinating, because when multiple big stars die, the resulting energy can expel gas from the galaxy, which in turn cools, causing new stars to be born,\" he added.  <br><br>According to Bullock, the distribution of stars extends beyond the classical disk of a galaxy. <br><br>Astronomers had assumed that galaxies were constructed over long periods of time. They believed that smaller groups of stars would enter the galaxy and be broken down by it. This would kick some of those stars into more distant orbits.  <br><br>But researchers from UCI think that this so-called \"supernova feedback\" could in fact be the source for up to 40% of outer-halo stars.  <br><br>\"They show us that as the galaxy center is rotating, a bubble driven by supernova feedback is developing with stars forming at its edge,\" Yu said. \"It looks as though the stars are being kicked out from the center.\" <br><br>Researchers said that there is a \"fair amount\" of observational evidence to suggest stars are forming in such a way.  <br><br>\"In plots that compare data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission -- which provides a 3D velocity chart of stars in the Milky Way -- with other maps that show stellar density and metallicity, we can see structures similar to those produced by outflow stars in our simulations,\" Yu said. <br><br>The study was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal on Monday. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "143", "title": "A shipwreck uncovered by waves every 20 or so years has been dated to pre-Revolutionary War times "}, {"id": "113", "title": "Scientists reconstruct skulls of 200 million-year-old dinosaur embryos in 'unprecedented' 3D detail"}, {"id": "38", "title": "Frogs hopped around the Antarctic 40 million years ago"}, {"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "24", "title": "'Killing Eve's' third season mostly feels like it's just killing time"}]}, "60": {"title": "Washington Post: Trump administration official in charge of coronavirus testing was forced out of vaccine research job", "content": "gton (CNN)The Trump administration official overseeing critical coronavirus testing in the US was forced out of a previous position developing vaccines at Texas A&M University -- a stint in which he made \"sweeping statements about the impact of his work, not all of which turned out as some had hoped,\" The Washington Post reported Monday.  <br><br>The Post said Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir, an unofficial member of the White House's coronavirus task force who worked on vaccine projects at the university for eight years, \"was told in 2015 he had 30 minutes to resign or he would be fired\" from his post at the school.  <br><br>Citing a local newspaper that reported on Giroir's annual evaluation, the Post said Giroir received a performance evaluation that \"said he was 'more interested in promoting yourself' than the health science center where he worked.

Scientists are noticing it, too. <br><br>Around the world, seismologists are observing a lot less ambient seismic noise -- meaning, the vibrations generated by cars, trains, buses and people going about their daily lives. And in the absence of that noise, Earth's upper crust is moving just a little less. <br><br>Thomas Lecocq, a geologist and seismologist at the Royal Observatory in Belgium, first pointed out this phenomenon in Brussels. <br><br>Brussels is seeing about a 30% to 50% reduction in ambient seismic noise since mid-March, around the time the country started implementing school and business closures and other social distancing measures, according to Lecocq. That noise level is on par with what seismologists would see on Christmas Day, he said. <br><br>Less noise means seismologists can detect smaller events <br><br>The reduction in noise has had a particularly interesting effect in Brussels: Lecocq and other seismologists are able to detect smaller earthquakes and other seismic events that certain seismic stations wouldn't have registered. <br><br>Take, for example, the seismic station in Brussels. In normal times, Lecocq said, it's \"basically useless.\" <br><br>Seismic stations are typically set up outside urban areas, because the reduced human noise makes it easier to pick up on subtle vibrations in the ground. The one in Brussels, however, was built more than a century ago and the city has since expanded around it. <br><br>The daily hum of city life means that the station in Brussels wouldn't typically pick up on smaller seismic events.

But then the wreck disappeared again, frustrating those who desired to know more about the ship's history.  <br><br>Now, the decades-long mystery has been somewhat solved after marine archaeologist Stefan Claesson discovered evidence that links the shipwreck to a Colonial-era ship called the Defiance that was built in 1754.  <br><br>To identify the origin of the shipwreck, Claesson, who is also the owner of Nearview, an aerial drone and archaeological surveying company, sent pieces of the wreck to the Cornell University Tree-Ring Laboratory.  <br><br>\"The sampled timbers matched a New England tree-ring index indicating a felling date of approximately 1753,\" Claesson told CNN.  <br><br>He then looked through nearly 50 years of notary records to discover that a sloop called Defiance had wrecked at the York Beach location in 1769.

The ship was carrying a cargo of flour, pork and English goods along with a four-man crew. But the ship encountered a fierce storm.  <br><br>\"They took anchor, but in heavy seas the crew was forced to cut the anchor cables, and they were pushed ashore onto York Beach,\" Claesson said. \"The ship was a total loss, but the crew survived.\"  <br><br>Claesson's discovery is significant because it's one a very few examples of a pre-Revolutionary War ship built in New England, he said.

King says the effect may be similar in dolphins. <br><br>\"Such synchronous and coordinated behaviour between allied males may therefore promote cooperative behaviour and regulate stress, as it has been shown to do in humans,\" said King in the press release. <br><br>During the next stage of the research the scientists will play recordings of the pop sounds to both male and female dolphins to see how they react, King said. <br><br>Then the team will investigate whether synchronized behavior affects success in mating. <br><br>Right now, scientists aren't sure if each male in an alliance mates with the female repeatedly during herding, or if only one of them gets the chance. <br><br>However, research shows that each male in a long-term alliance appears to father a similar number of babies. <br><br>The team want to build on their research to see if certain pop sounds mean some groups are more successful at mating than others. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "113", "title": "Scientists reconstruct skulls of 200 million-year-old dinosaur embryos in 'unprecedented' 3D detail"}, {"id": "54", "title": "Why Elon Musk's Starlink satellites are upsetting stargazers -- again"}, {"id": "84", "title": "US may have to endure social distancing until 2022 if no vaccine is quickly found, scientists predict"}, {"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "143", "title": "A shipwreck uncovered by waves every 20 or so years has been dated to pre-Revolutionary War times "}]}, "158": {"title": "Math teacher shows up at student's front porch to give her a one-on-one lesson while social distancing", "content": "For 12-year-old Rylee Anderson, the algebra concept of graphing a function just didn't make sense.  <br><br>Since her classes are now all remote due to the coronavirus pandemic, Anderson emailed her teacher for help, rather than ask for it in the classroom. <br><br>She expected some emails, or maybe even a phone call from her teacher, Mr. Chris Waba.  <br><br>But then the doorbell rang -- and she saw Waba, standing on her porch, holding a whiteboard and marker, ready to teach. <br><br>Anderson, like most students in the US, has been out of school and learning virtually because of the coronavirus outbreak.  <br><br>The Madison, South Dakota student said while trying to complete her math homework, she couldn't ask her parents for help because they weren't home.

Yeung and Chen noted many traditional Chinese restaurants in major cities' Chinatown districts shun delivery services such as GrubHub, because those services charge high fees.  <br><br>\"These [Chinese restaurants] were on thin operating margins before,\" Yeung explained. \"Transitioning over to [tech] delivery is going to make that even thinner.\"  <br><br>Chen said he hopes Chinese restaurants will receive targeted relief funding and programs from the local, state and federal government. \"If we don't get the breaks, we cannot break even,\" Chen said. <br><br>Congress is expected to approve a deal to replenish the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program, which last month quickly depleted its $349 billion economic-rescue fund for small businesses. Some of those funds would be set aside for under-served businesses, including those run by minorities. <br><br>A large portion of the nation's Chinese restaurants are independent and lack the capital reserves held by corporate chains, which may be better positioned to weather the financial storm from the coronavirus, said a spokesperson for P.F. Chang, which has more than 200 US restaurants.  <br><br>The spokesperson said the Asian cuisine chain's takeout and delivery business has \"doubled in size\" since mid-March. <br><br>\"The model that every type of restaurant across our country must currently operate under is, fortunately, one that we know well and are exceptionally good at,\" a P.F.

The shares had been above the offering price until Ed Bastian, the CEO of rival Delta Air Lines (DAL), told investors on a company conference call that it could take three years for there to be a full recovery in air travel. That comment helped send airline stocks broadly lower. <br><br>United's decision to try to sell stock at the current price could be seen as a signal to the market that executives there believe the worst is over, according to Jonathan Macey, professor of corporate law and corporate finance at Yale University. <br><br>\"If the market perceives the company to be struggling, a secondary offering isn't going to work,\" he said. \"To the extent it's successful, it shows there is confidence that this is the bottom.\" <br><br>Experts said if the offering is successful other airlines may follow suit.  <br><br>\"In a normal time, issuing additional shares is not something a company in United's position would consider doing.

Infection maps show hot spots on the East Coast, through the Midwest, down in Florida, to the West in Texas and with more misery afflicting the Pacific coast region. But the vast interior seems largely untouched \u2014 one reason why local leaders want to fire up normal life. <br><br>  <br><br>Rural Americans have some advantages when it comes to avoiding the coronavirus. Cars and pick-up trucks are the transport of choice, rather than crowded pathogen-spreading subways. Scattered single homes are already a form of social distancing compared with densely packed apartment buildings. And there are simply fewer people around to infect one another. <br><br>  <br><br>On Tuesday, the Midwestern state of Nebraska had registered 1,685 cases of Covid-19 and only 33 deaths. Its curve might be accelerating, but it's still far safer to be a Nebraskan than a New Yorker. The Cornhusker State had 87 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people. The Empire State had 1,328. <br><br>  <br><br>But life away from the urban crush brings its own problems. In rural areas, hospitals are often sparse, poorly equipped, have only a few ICU beds and suffer from a shortage of doctors. It's harder to get quick test results. And rudimentary health care in some areas means patients have preexisting conditions that carry a higher risk of Covid complications.  <br><br>  <br><br>\"We have not dodged this in any way,\" says Dr. Angela Hewlett, associate professor at the division of infectious diseases at the University of Nebraska. \"I'm afraid what we are going to see is a peak, a downslope and, if we go back to business as usual in any way, we are going to see another peak and possibly a lot more cases.\" Another interior state, Utah, has seen hot spots around ski resorts and cities. <br><br>  <br><br>Infection curves in the country will be slower than in populous metropolitan areas -- but will be sustained for longer in a series of mini-epidemics. \"We are going to be fighting this for weeks and months to come,\" says Dr. Andrew Pavia, who heads the pediatric infectious diseases division at the University of Utah School of Medicine. \"It is going to make reopening that much more challenging.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "200", "title": "How long can we live under lockdown?"}, {"id": "27", "title": "Quibi might have a flawed model, but the first problem is its shows aren't very good"}, {"id": "228", "title": "Is this the end of political conventions?"}, {"id": "84", "title": "US may have to endure social distancing until 2022 if no vaccine is quickly found, scientists predict"}, {"id": "143", "title": "A shipwreck uncovered by waves every 20 or so years has been dated to pre-Revolutionary War times "}]}, "193": {"title": "China is becoming a defining issue in the clash between Biden and Trump", "content": "nalysis was excerpted from the April 23 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers.

There's no crunch from the gears of a school bus that's seen better days, nor the deepening whine of a jet's engine overhead as the pilot approaches Washington National airport. The wail of an ambulance siren can take you to a dark place. <br><br>  <br><br>For all of the footage of beaches reopening and mask-free protesters demanding their liberties, the most remarkable aspect of the US near-lockdown is how comprehensive it is: As of this weekend, more than 97% of Americans were under some sort of confinement guidelines, and most are complying. Nothing remotely like this has happened on such a large scale in American history. <br><br>  <br><br>Distrust of government is part of American DNA, so more rebellion might have been expected. The governor of Georgia has already announced plans to begin opening his state in defiance of medical logic from Friday. But polls suggest that a majority of Americans aren't yet ready for normality. Their altruism is saving lives. Though the US death toll is staggering -- more than 42,000 and rising -- hospital admissions are slowing in hot spots like New York, New Orleans and Detroit. <br><br>  <br><br>But if infections slow, it will get ever harder for mayors and governors to keep people off the streets -- especially as economic pain bites deeper and the US President cheers for reopening. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned it's only \"half time.\" But he and other local leaders know that enforcing any timeline still depends on the goodwill of a critical mass of citizens. <br><br>Meanwhile in Brazil... <br><br>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro can't keep his mouth shut, literally. Sunday he coughed several times as he spoke to supporters at a rally without a mask on. Earlier this month he was caught on camera wiping his nose with the back of his hand before shaking an elderly woman's hand. Last month, a newspaper featured a front-page picture of him projecting saliva as he spoke. <br><br>  <br><br>But for his detractors, the bigger problem is what he says. Bolsonaro has repeatedly clashed with state governors as they closed schools, suspended public transportation and shuttered all but essential businesses, in an attempt to contain the lethal coronavirus. <br><br>  <br><br>On Sunday, Bolsonaro even joined protesters in front of the army headquarters in Brasilia who were demanding an end to lockdown. Many were urging the military to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court, due to their support for mitigation measures.  <br><br>  <br><br>The President praised the protesters as \"patriots\" and said their liberty must be guaranteed. \"It's the people who are in power,\" he declared then. <br><br>  <br><br>Faced with growing backlash on Monday, Bolsonaro defended his participation in the rally, saying that he hadn't personally called to dismantle the other branches of government. \"Usually, when people are conspiring against someone, it's to reach a position of power,\" he said. \"I'm already in power.

They also debate party rules and what the party platform should look like.\u00a0 <br><br>But for the most part, they are badly outmoded. A series of speeches no one watches. Lots of back-slapping, expensive parties and self-congratulation. Pomp and circumstance to no real end. <br><br>The Point: I could never go to another political convention and be perfectly happy.

The autonomy of the battery-powered assistant has been increased by about 30 percent.\" <br><br>CIMON got its name from a reference to the fictional Professor Simon Wright, the \"flying brain\" robotic assistant from the Japanese \"Captain Future\" sci-fi series. The robot was created with the ability to understand, speak, hear and see. The astronaut assistant can even nod and shake its head -- which is essentially CIMON's entire body. <br><br>In the beginning, the 3D printed plastic was called a \"spaceball\" by its engineers.  <br><br>The original CIMON was initially designed to help astronauts efficiently complete their work by explaining instructions and information for repairs and experiments, offering hands-free access to documents and media and acting as a mobile camera.

For example, CIMON can provide information on next steps for an experiment or take photos and videos of a specific point in the lab [to] assist the astronauts in their daily work.\" <br><br>But CIMON-2 can also be a conversational companion for lonely astronauts. CIMON-2 uses two cameras as its eyes for facial recognition and five others to help it autonomously navigate and record video.  <br><br>CIMON-2 relies on human interaction to learn.  <br><br>Microphones help it interpret voices and identify its location while fans help it rotate and turn to face astronauts when called. Psychologists helped CIMON-2 develop a personality, and it can respond using different tones, from teasing to sad.  <br><br>\"CIMON is a technology experiment to find out how virtual agents can support astronauts and increase the efficiency of their work,\" Biniok said. \" Another important topic is research on isolation and loneliness and the effects of stress on the physical body and how virtual assistants can help astronauts cope with these problems.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "111", "title": "NASA astronaut, Russian cosmonauts launch to the space station during a pandemic"}, {"id": "154", "title": "NASA and SpaceX prepare to launch astronauts from the US again"}, {"id": "122", "title": "Your child can become an astronaut and explore space from home with NASA "}, {"id": "137", "title": "Start your Monday smart: OPEC, primaries, Holy Week, Passover, supermoon, Quibi, ISS"}, {"id": "55", "title": "This Republican's logic on reopening the country is totally illogical"}]}, "55": {"title": "This Republican's logic on reopening the country is totally illogical", "content": "Texas Lt.

And I don't blame them. But let's face reality of where we are. In Texas, we have 29 million people. We've lost 195. And every life is valuable. But 500 people out of 29 million. And we're locked down. And we're crushing the average worker. We're crushing small business. We're crushing the markets. We're crushing this country.  <br><br>\"And what I said when I was with you that night, there are more important things than living. And that's saving this country for my children and my grandchildren. And saving this country for all of us. And I don't want to die. Nobody wants to die. But man, we've got to take some risks. And get back in the game. And get this country back up and running.\" <br><br>As Patrick notes, he's made a similar argument before. Back in late March, he told Carlson this:  \"Are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that's the exchange, I'm all in.\" <br><br>So, see, he was right! Or something. <br><br>Let's first understand Patrick's logic before we show how incredibly illogical it is, shall we? <br><br>His thinking goes like this: The science has been all over the place on the coronavirus, so it's the \"wrong science.\" And since experts -- including medical doctors like Anthony Fauci -- don't really know where this is all headed then we can't take their word for it. And what we know is that the economy is in very bad shape -- and getting worse every day that we stay quarantined. So we need to take some risks. We need to get back to business as (mostly) usual even if that means more people die because, uh, there are \"more important things than living.\" <br><br>So, that's the argument. In a nutshell. <br><br>Now, for showing why it's totally and completely wrong. <br><br>1)  Patrick's dismissal of \"science\" appears entirely based on the fact that projections about how many people will die have been all over the map. But projections are just that -- attempts to project the future of a very uncertain set of circumstances. Any model that produces a projection like the ones Patrick is dismissing rely on a series of data and assumptions. So yes, if NO social distancing measures had been put in place, it is possible several million Americans could have died. And now that most states have adhered to stay-at-home and social distancing measures, those numbers are much lower. Projections changing is, well, what good projections do when the underlying data and assumptions change. <br><br>As for the actual \"science\" here, Patrick is dead wrong about it. The science has been pretty damn accurate actually. Doctors have made clear for months that Covid-19 posed a unique threat because of its high level of transmissibility, the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, no herd immunity and the lack of a vaccine or even an effective treatment. All of which is still true. <br><br>2) Patrick seems not to grasp the difference between necessary and unnecessary risks. It is absolutely true that every time you get behind the wheel of a car or fly on an airplane, there is a risk of dying. But you accept that risk as minimal and necessary because you a) use your car to get to work or b) want to see parts of the world that only a plane can get you to. So you take what you believe to be a necessary risk. <br><br>That's very different than what Patrick is advocating for here. Reopening the country -- given what we know about the deadly effects of coronavirus -- is an unnecessary risk. Coronavirus is now the leading cause of death in the country. It has infected more than three-quarters of a million people and killed 41,000 as of Tuesday morning.  <br><br>And there's this: Deciding to go back to your normal routines doesn't just impact you. It impacts every single person you come into contact with. because, without widespread testing, who's to say that you aren't an asymptomatic carrier of the virus? Or that your symptoms simply haven't begun to show yet? Again, unnecessary risk. <br><br>3) I keep trying to wrap my mind around Patrick's claim that \"there are more important things than living.\" As a Catholic, I do understand the belief that if we die, we can hope for the reward of Heaven, which is a far better place than life on Earth. But that doesn't seem to be the argument Patrick is actually making. He seems to be suggesting that an economic slowdown or recession is worse than dying. Which, like, no? <br><br>The point here is that Patrick's argument might make some sense to people the first time they hear it. The economy is struggling! And projections about the number of deaths from coronavirus have been all over the map! <br><br>But scratch the surface and you quickly see the profoundly illogical underpinning what Patrick is saying. My worry -- and it should be your worry too -- is that lots of people listening to Patrick don't scratch the surface. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "137", "title": "Start your Monday smart: OPEC, primaries, Holy Week, Passover, supermoon, Quibi, ISS"}, {"id": "104", "title": "10 commandments for better sleep "}, {"id": "185", "title": "WFH burnout is real.

In reality, there should be another \"s\" word in that list: sleep. <br><br>We're supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night, depending on our age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that a third of Americans sleep fewer than seven hours a night. It's a global problem too. <br><br>\"Sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health and quality of life for up to 45% of the world's population,\" according to the World Sleep Society, a non-profit organization of sleep professionals dedicated to advancing \"sleep health worldwide.\"  <br><br>Yet how does anyone get to sleep today in the turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic? Workplaces and schools are shutting down, meaning hourly workers are without paychecks if they can't work and children used to free lunch are not getting fed -- never mind our concerns about elections, global stock market meltdowns or escalating border or trade wars.  <br><br>It's a lot, folks, but failing to sleep isn't going to make things better.  <br><br>Poor sleep contributes to weight gain, a lack of sex drive, a dysfunctional immune system, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety and other disorders. <br><br>Yet despite this nuclear fallout for our health, we still don't prioritize sleep -- even when the stock market isn't crashing. <br><br>To combat that, sleep experts from the World Sleep Society have created these ten commandments of sleep hygiene for weary adults. <br><br>Establish a regular bedtime and waking time <br><br>Messing with our circadian rhythm, the internal sleep clock that tells us when it's time to sleep and rise, has been linked to hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes and, most recently, the risk of having a heart attack or heart disease. <br><br>Changing your regular sleep-wake time by 90 minutes in either direction, which many of us do on the weekends, doubled the risk of cardiovascular disease over a five-year period. The more days you sleep irregularly, the higher the risk, a study found. <br><br>\"People are living busy, stressful lives and not getting a lot of sleep during the week,\" Dr. David Goff, who directs the division of cardiovascular sciences at the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, told CNN in a recent interview. <br><br>\"Then they are trying to get catchup sleep on the weekend, and that's not a healthy pattern,\" Goff said. <br><br>Watch your napping <br><br>While an occasional short snooze can be healthy, the World Sleep Society's second commandment warns: \"If you are in the habit of taking siestas, do not exceed 45 minutes of daytime sleep.\" <br><br>One reason is because we typically enter a \"deep sleep\" cycle about 30 to 40 minutes into a nap. Waking up from deep sleep produces that \"Where am I?\" grogginess that is worse than no nap at all. A long nap can also interfere with your body clock, making it more difficult to fall asleep later that night. <br><br>Generally, catnaps that are approximately 15 to 20 minutes are fine, experts say, and may reduce fatigue; boost creativity; increase alertness; jumpstart cognitive performance; and improve mood. But try to do them earlier in the day -- before 3 p.m. -- to avoid affecting that night's full sleep cycle. <br><br>No alcohol or cigarettes <br><br>The third commandment is to \"avoid excessive alcohol ingestion four hours before bedtime, and do not smoke.\"  <br><br>It's truly a myth that a drink will help you sleep better at night. Instead, it traps you in the lighter stages of sleep and \"dramatically reduces the quality of your rest at night,\" said Rebecca Robbins, a fellow at Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, in a prior CNN interview.  <br><br>\"It continues to pull you out of rapid eye movement and the deeper stages of sleep, causing you to wake up not feeling restored,\" Robbins said. <br><br>Avoid caffeine six hours before bedtime <br><br>Here's a no-brainer: Boycott caffeine at least six hours before your normal bedtime (some experts say nothing after 3 p.m.). And caffeine is in more than just coffee, so the World Sleep Society also warns about tea and many sodas, as well as chocolate.  <br><br>Yes, chocolate. That cup of hot chocolate you think may help you sleep could contain 25 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of green or black tea will provide 50 milligrams of caffeine. <br><br>Avoid eating certain foods <br><br>The fifth commandment: \"Avoid heavy, spicy, or sugary foods four hours before bedtime.\" <br><br>Heavy and spicy foods may give you heartburn or other digestive issues, thus affecting your ability to get and stay asleep. As for sugar, studies show it's linked to restless, disturbed sleep and may possibly affect hormones that control cravings.  <br><br>A light snack before bed \"is acceptable,\" according to the commandment. The National Sleep Foundation recommends munching on a handful of nuts; a few cherries (which are high in melatonin); a banana (which contains muscle relaxers potassium and magnesium) and decaffeinated teas such as chamomile, ginger and peppermint.  <br><br>Exercise regularly, but not right before bed <br><br>Surveys of vigorous exercisers by the National Sleep Foundation show they are almost twice as likely to report high-quality, regular sleep compared to non-exercisers, and sitting for long periods of time is thought to be connected to poor sleep. <br><br>While studies haven't proven that exercise just before bed will harm sleep, many experts -- like the World Sleep Society -- recommend avoiding it. Why? Because moderate exercise heats up your core temperature, signaling the body that it's time to be awake, while the release of endorphins is thought to keep some of us alert. <br><br>Of course if you're a night owl, that may not apply to you -- so listen to your body clock. For any of us, however, doing some yoga, Tai chi or light stretching before bed could help with relaxation. <br><br>Improve your sleep environment <br><br>Having just the right sleep environment is so important that the remaining four commandments focus on how to do that. <br><br>First, keep your bedroom well-ventilated and pick a comfortable sleep temperature setting. Science is pretty much sure that a cool temperature is best, so aim for between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). <br><br>Make sure you have \"comfortable, inviting bedding\" that fits your personal preferences (and hopefully that of any significant bed partner). \"Block out all distracting noise\" -- I sleep with a fan every night -- and get rid of any light, even the blue light from your charging smartphone.  <br><br>While you're at it, go ahead and turn off any work alerts (Slack or email ping at 2 a.m., anyone?). Better still, just charge the thing outside your bedroom. <br><br>And last, but not least, \"reserve your bed for sleep and sex.\" As normal as it seems to work from home in bed or play games with the kids in bed, that doesn't teach your brain to view the bedroom as a place for slumber. <br><br>That's right, just like your dog knows a walk is coming when it sees the leash, you can train your brain to associate your bed with sleep. <br><br>And there you have it. Hopefully these 10 commandments can help you part the seas to successful slumber. <br><br>Can't do all 10 things? Pick just one, and see if you can make it happen. Little successes will build upon each other and lead to a happier (and more rested) you.  <br><br>CNN's Katia Hetter contributed to this story. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "185", "title": "WFH burnout is real.

Travel restrictions prevented some of the astronauts' families, media and industry officials from attending the launch. Those involved in the launch were all seen keeping six feet apart and wearing masks.  <br><br>But many of the health and safety precautions taken were standard for astronauts launching to the space station.  <br><br>NASA has a long history of quarantining astronauts before they go to space to prevent illnesses like cold and flu from occurring off our planet. It was a concern even in the early days of the agency's astronaut program. <br><br>\"The health and welfare of the crew is always paramount,\" said Courtney Beasley, communications specialist at NASA's Johnson Space Center. \"All of our crew must stay in quarantine for two weeks before they launch. This ensures that they aren't sick or incubating an illness when they get to the space station, and is called 'health stabilization.'\" <br><br>Ahead of quarantine, the astronauts followed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations regarding coronavirus. NASA and the Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos, maintained the standard quarantine period of two weeks for the crew, Beasley said.  <br><br>\"During quarantine, the astronauts live in their crew quarters -- NASA has crew quarters for this purpose at Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers -- and Roscosmos has them in Baikonur,\" she said.  \"They don't have direct contact with anyone who has not been pre-cleared by NASA flight surgeons. The time is spent preparing for flight, studying and resting, as well as working out and making video calls to friends and family members.\" <br><br>About six hours after Thursday morning's launch, the astronauts docked with the International Space Station at 10:13 a.m. ET. The hatches opened at 12:28 p.m. ET and they joined Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan. <br><br>Skripochka and Meir will return to Earth on April 17 after spending six months on the station. Morgan, who will also return to Earth with them, launched to the station on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing and had an extended mission of eight months. <br><br>When Skripochka, Meir and Morgan return from their stay in space, they will be coming back to a very different Earth. When they launched, coronavirus wasn't a threat. Now, it's a pandemic.  <br><br>NASA already has a protocol in place for returning astronauts that includes a post-landing medical check by flight doctors. The doctors and other NASA teams help the astronauts reacclimate to Earth's gravity, getting them up and walking soon after landing. In the weeks after, they're monitored to make sure they're healthy. <br><br>This time, the protocols will be more extensive.  <br><br>\"NASA will closely adhere to the CDC's recommendations on infection control for the coronavirus as Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir return to Earth and begin their post-flight medical testing and readaptation period,\"  Beasley said.  <br><br>\"This includes cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home, and limiting contact with the crew members.\" <br><br>On April 15, two days before the current crew returns to Earth, a \"change of command ceremony\" will take place on the station as the new crew takes over, according to NASA.  <br><br>This is the third spaceflight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and it's the first for Vagner.  <br><br>Cassidy was selected by NASA to be an astronaut in 2004. The Navy captain also served for 11 years as a member of the US Navy SEALs Team. His previous spaceflight experience includes a shuttle mission on Endeavour to help with assembly of the Space Station in 2009. During that flight, he became the 500th person in history to fly in space.  <br><br>He also spent six months on the space station in 2013, one of the first crew members to participate in the new rendezvous system that shortened docking with the space station from two days to six hours. <br><br>Cassidy, Ivanishin and Vagner will also welcome NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley when they arrive at the space station in mid-to-late May on NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 flight test. <br><br>It will be the first time astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket and spacecraft from American soil since the final space shuttle mission in 2011. Since then, crews launching to the International Space Station have been leaving from Baikonur aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.  <br><br>Demo-2 is the final flight test of the system before SpaceX is certified to carry out operational crew flights to and from the space station for NASA, the agency said.  <br><br>The agency is monitoring CDC guidance with regards to mission planning, they said.

Since the last shuttle mission in July 2011, crews launching to the International Space Station have been conducted from Baikonur in Russia aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.  <br><br>The agency is monitoring CDC guidance with regards to mission planning amid the coronavirus pandemic, they said. The launch date could be postponed. All NASA centers are currently operating with non-mission-essential work occurring remotely, which limits employee contact with the crew, according to the agency. <br><br>But for now, things are going according to plan. NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are expected to be on the May flight test in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on top of a Falcon 9 rocket. It is the final flight test of the system before SpaceX is certified to carry out operational crew flights to and from the space station for NASA, the agency said.  <br><br>Hurley and Behnken have been practicing in a Crew Dragon simulator over the last few months. Flight control teams for NASA and SpaceX in Florida, Texas and California have also been simulating different aspects of the mission to practice ahead of the Demo-2 launch.  <br><br>In March, the simulations closely mirrored the mission itself, simulating timelines that began with pre-launch procedures and continued all the way to docking with the space station. They also simulated leaving the space station and splashing down back to Earth. <br><br>\"The simulations were a great opportunity to practice procedures and to coordinate decision-making for the mission management team, especially with respect to weather,\" said Michael Hess, manager of Operations Integration for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. \"Simulation supervisors do a great job at picking cases that really make the team think and discuss.\" <br><br>The Crew Dragon spacecraft is also being prepped for pre-launch and going through the final tests at the SpaceX facility near Cape Canaveral in Florida.  <br><br>This leads to \"more simulations, final crew training and flight readiness reviews to ensure all of the mission systems and subsystems are ready for a crewed test flight,\" Hess said. <br><br>Commercial partners like SpaceX are opening up access to low-Earth orbit, like the space station.  <br><br>\"What's happening in commercial crew is a big deal,\" Hess said. \"This new spacecraft, Crew Dragon, was designed and built by SpaceX, not by NASA and traditional contractor partnerships. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will definitely be earning their spacecraft test pilot wings with this mission. Also, the Space Station Program is really looking forward to another way to rotate crews to [the] station to perform science and experiments to benefit all.\" <br><br>Demo-2 is the final test before NASA transitions to operational crewed flights to the space station using the Crew Dragon spacecraft.  <br><br>The first mission, slated for launch later this year if Demo-2 is successful, will send NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Shannon Walker and Victor Glover Jr., as well as Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, up for a six-month stint on the space station.  <br><br>It will be the second spaceflight for Walker and Hopkins, who have both been on the space station before, and the first for Glover. It's Noguchi's third spaceflight; he was formerly a space shuttle and space station crew member. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "111", "title": "NASA astronaut, Russian cosmonauts launch to the space station during a pandemic"}, {"id": "53", "title": "This robot is helping astronauts on the space station with tasks, stress and isolation "}, {"id": "122", "title": "Your child can become an astronaut and explore space from home with NASA "}, {"id": "137", "title": "Start your Monday smart: OPEC, primaries, Holy Week, Passover, supermoon, Quibi, ISS"}, {"id": "55", "title": "This Republican's logic on reopening the country is totally illogical"}]}, "185": {"title": "WFH burnout is real.

Shut out all the noise -- the email, the Slacks, the texts, the Twitter notifications, the constant worry about that big project -- and just took a moment for yourself to regroup and refocus? <br><br>I'll wait. <br><br>Still thinking? <br><br>Here's the thing: Workplace burnout doesn't solely happen when you're putting in long hours at the office. It's also a risk when you're working from home, camped out at your kitchen table in your sweats. <br><br>In fact, the risk could be even greater given our current situation. <br><br>One expert told me the suddenness with which so many of us were forced to start working from home -- while also losing our childcare in many cases -- combined with a global pandemic that seems to have no end in sight, means the risk of burnout has intensified. <br><br>Not great news. We've got enough on our plates to worry about. <br><br>So here are the signs of burnout and what you can do about it. <br><br>Work-life imbalance. When you were going into an office every day there was a clear distinction between your work life and personal time. But now that you don't have a commute to mark the beginning and end of your day and your office could now be in your kitchen, you can end up working all the time if you're not careful. <br><br>How to fight it: Set your work hours, communicate them with your boss and colleagues and then stick to them. (Yes, there will be times when you will work late, but try to make that the exception, not the rule.) It can also help to create a signal that it's time for you to switch gears to personal time: Some people change into more comfortable clothes, go outside and hit Wiffle balls, while others go for a run or workout. <br><br>Lack of control. Employees who feel that they lack control over their schedules, interactions and time management are at risk of burning out. <br><br>How to fight it: Create a schedule that designates time for work, family and yourself -- and then be sure to stick to it. <br><br>Missing social connections. Even if you're in a crowded house, your family members might not offer the same support your colleagues did when it comes to issues with work. <br><br>How to fight it: You have to be more deliberate with your social interactions when working from home. It takes a little more effort, but continue to reach out to your co-workers: Slack them, set up a quick video check-in and lean on them the way you would at work.  <br><br>Hospitals turn to VR to train doctors and nurses  <br><br>Hospitals across the globe are getting an assist from virtual reality to help fill staffing shortages. <br><br>CNN's Samantha Murphy Kelly reports that hospitals are using virtual reality to help teach skills like how to assess a patient's symptoms or perform CPR while wearing protective gear. <br><br>This allows doctors and nurses with expertise in other fields, like knee surgery or neurology, but little or no experience in treating infectious diseases, to help with Covid-19 patients. <br><br>Just like that: $350 billion gone in a flash  <br><br>Well, that didn't take long. <br><br>It took less than two weeks for the government's $350 billion forgivable small business loan program to be fully tapped out. <br><br>The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was created under the $2 trillion stimulus package and offers loan guarantees for small businesses as the economy remains on hold. <br><br>The first-come, first-served program officially launched on April 3rd and was plagued by problems from the start. A lack of guidance from the government left banks and small business owners confused. <br><br>The quick depletion wasn't unexpected: Lenders had tens of thousands of small businesses waiting to apply before the program launched. <br><br>Read this report from CNN's Jeanne Sahadi on what small business should do now. <br><br>There is some good news. Congress seems to be very close to adding more funds to the program. <br><br>In the meantime, here are four free resources that small business owners can take advantage of right now. <br><br>Still haven't gotten your stimulus check?  <br><br>If you are still waiting for your check to arrive from Uncle Sam -- don't panic.  <br><br>Around 60 million Americans still haven't received their payments yet, according to CNN's Katie Lobosco. <br><br>The government sent out checks to roughly 80 million people last week, starting with those who filed their federal taxes in 2018 or 2019 and were due a refund and authorized direct deposit. <br><br>If you are wondering where your check might be, check out these five reasons you might not have received your money. <br><br>Making your small space functional...and beautiful   <br><br>Being stuck inside your home for the majority of the day is tough.

Despite lifestyle factors that would ordinarily increase a person's risk for such conditions, the Mosuo had a lower risk for hypertension and diabetes-associated anemia than low-altitude Han populations.   <br><br>\"The key message is 'look how cool this is,' when high-altitude adaptations have effects beyond [being just] high-altitude adaptations, which we weren't expecting,\" said co-author Katherine Wander, assistant professor of anthropology at Binghamton University in New York state. <br><br>\"Human biological variation matters for our chronic disease risk. And studying that intersection of genetic adaptations and chronic disease risk is really pretty important for people generally, not just for the Mosuo.\" <br><br>A history of built-in protection <br><br>People have been living on the Tibetan Plateau at altitudes of up to approximately 17,700 feet for thousands of years, the report said, and their characteristics seem to be what mitigate hypoxic stress. <br><br>Whereas travelers to high altitudes experience about a 10% to 20% drop in oxygen uptake -- which is the rate at which oxygen can be used by the body during maximal work -- Tibetans show no deficit. That's because their bodies naturally dilate their blood vessels in a process called vasodilation to compensate for the reduced oxygen content. This raises their blood supply and lowers their blood pressure to enhance oxygen delivery in their arteries.  <br><br>These characteristics are likely to lower hypertension, the study said, as hypertension may be caused by underproduction of vasodilators that help blood flow, and thickening arteries.  <br><br>Tibetan populations also have an adaptation called blunted erythropoiesis, or blunted red blood cell production. When our bodies undergo hypoxic stress, a mechanism in the kidneys signals an excessive amount of red blood cells to deliver oxygen to tissues, making really thick blood. <br><br>In people with diabetes, this natural process could be harmful. Because of malfunctioning kidneys, they have an impaired sensitivity to hypoxia, which impedes their ability to correct anemia, the deficiency of red blood cells. But the Mosuos' adaptation switches off that specific kidney function, which could protect them from this outcome, Wander said.  <br><br>According to previous studies, many Mosuo communities are undergoing a rapid process of economic integration associated primarily with increasing tourism in the Yunnan province, changing their diets, physical activity and social structure.  <br><br>\"We've been able to kind of study the effects of that transition from mostly subsistence agriculture to the tourism industry and how that's affected people's health,\" Wander said. \"Their physical activity has changed because they're not doing as much farm labor and their diets have changed because [they have more] access to things like sugar-sweetened beverages and highly processed foods.\" <br><br>Incidence of chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension have spiked among populations who underwent the same changes. But when researchers found the Mosuo had high rates of diabetes but not hypertension, they decided to take a second look at how chronic diseases and high-altitude adaptations interact.  <br><br>Native adaptations and chronic disease risk  <br><br>To test the intersection between adaptations and chronic disease, researchers collected data among the Mosuo in the Yunnan province and retrieved data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey for the Han comparison groups: all Han who were included in the CHNS data, and a smaller group limited to Han from rural Hunan. <br><br>Rural Hunan is southern and inland like the Mosuo homeland, but about 320 to 2,600 feet lower in altitude.  <br><br>Researchers compared hypertension risk among Mosuo and Han populations as they have similar risk factors given they are comparable in terms of diet. To find the risk for diabetes-associated anemia, they compared models of anemia across all three groups. <br><br>Hypertension was common among all groups, but significantly lower in the Mosuo.  <br><br>Diabetes was also common among all groups, with a higher prevalence among the Mosuo -- likely attributable to diet and lifestyle changes imparted by the tourism increase.  <br><br>However, diabetes-associated anemia was common among the Han, but not the Mosuo. It's likely the Mosuo are protected from the condition because of their blunted red blood cell production adaptation, the researchers said. <br><br>\"The Mosuo have lower risk for hypertension and diabetes-associated anemia than the Han, supporting the hypothesis that high-altitude adaptations affecting blood and circulation intersect with chronic disease processes to lower risk for these outcomes,\" the study said.  <br><br>However, the study didn't analyze a low-elevation sample of the Mosuo people for comparison.   <br><br>As chronic diseases increasingly become global health concerns, the researchers said, it's \"important to investigate how they may be affected by local genetic adaptions.\" <br><br>\"It's entirely possible that humans have adapted to other aspects of their environments, like infectious disease risks, in more subtle ways,\" Wander said. \"So as we come to understand biological variation ... we can think about how that variation might intersect with chronic disease risks.\" <br><br>A previous version of this article did not make a distinction between genetic adaptations and chronic disease risk. The article also referred to the wrong group name in the study and misquoted Katherine Wander.

About an hour after his allegation became public, his acting successor sent a tersely worded email to Bright's former staff at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) asking them to \"not respond to outside inquiries regarding the recent news.\" <br><br>\"Please do not discuss the current situation,\" wrote Gary Disbrow, according to an email obtained by CNN. <br><br>Bright's decision to go public is now exposing months of turmoil inside one of the key divisions at the Department of Health and Human Services charged with responding to the coronavirus pandemic. His allegations raise serious questions about political bias creeping into the government's response to the pandemic and the extent to which Trump's preferences for a drug overshadowed its scientific merits. <br><br>Countering Bright's allegations of political retaliation, five current and former administration officials are now also leveling a range of allegations against Bright, including: accusing him of poorly managing his office, mistreating staff and failing to consult his superiors on consequential decisions. Four current and former administration officials say Bright's removal had been a long time coming and preceded any disagreements over the use of hydroxychloroquine. <br><br>The White House has yet to respond directly to his allegations published in a lengthy statement Wednesday, but Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlan Oakley pushed back on Bright's claim of retaliation. She said he had requested the Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to secure doses of chloroquine for the strategic national stockpile. <br><br>While BARDA is a little-known government agency, it is internally powerful, given the office's sizable budget and purchasing power -- and under Bright, it was working to develop a coronavirus vaccine. <br><br>One current and one former Health and Human Services official said Bright faced numerous complaints from staff who accused him of mistreating employees including fits of anger in which he \"slammed things down on tables and broke binders.\" In another instance, he tore up a staffer's work in front of them, calling it junk, the former official said. Some staffers requested reassignments to other offices as a result and the former official said it led to decreased output from the research office. <br><br>But Bright's most recent performance review from May 2019, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, offers the most direct rebuttal to the allegations, delivering rave reviews for Bright's management of his office and includes no criticisms. Bob Kadlec, who carried out the review, doled out top marks for Bright's performance, calling his tenure \"very successful\" and giving him a weighted score of 480 out of 500. <br><br>Two officials said Bright's superiors ultimately decided that his management style was hampering BARDA's effectiveness as a key office in the response to the coronavirus and decided to dismiss him from his post, shifting him to a different position at the National Institutes of Health -- a position Bright has not accepted as he fights for his old job. <br><br>A current Health and Human Services official said Bright was \"temperamental\" and \"demanding,\" but said it was the result of his \"high expectations.\" <br><br>While some sources suggested Bright has slowed the offices output, Kadlec repeatedly praised both the quality and speed of BARDA's work under Bright's leadership, noting that \"BARDA continues to develop and licensure of medical countermeasures at a rate that is well above the industry average and certainly a subject of their envy.\" <br><br>While Bright received the highest score of \"5\" on all other categories, he scored a 4 in the section entitled \"Leading People.\" Still, Kadlec praises Bright for \"effectively\" leading his staff and included no criticisms. <br><br>The former top Health and Human Services official who hired Bright also defended his work on CNN Thursday morning.  <br><br>\"Dr. Bright is a strong scientist, he is a visionary leader, he's able to make decisions he get things done, and he believes and he stands on strong science,\" former Assistant Secretary Dr. Nicole Lurie said. \"I think this is about something larger than hydroxychloroquine. I think it's really about listening to scientific opinion, scientific perspective and standing up for strong science.\"  <br><br>Bright also came under fire recently for what others saw as unilateral decision-making. A person familiar with the dynamic said this likely wouldn't have bothered others in a normal time, but was seen as subversive given the pandemic. Bright had the authority to unilaterally select which companies BARDA would give funding to pursue a certain product. This purchasing power came under scrutiny as the coronavirus outbreak spread throughout the United States -- and the urgency for treatments and a vaccine grew.  <br><br>Three people familiar with the dynamics said Bright was not consulting others before moving forward with big decisions and felt \"he thought he knew what was best.\" <br><br>Now, Bright is fighting to be reinstated in his position. After learning from an assistant over the weekend that he was being removed from his role, he secured a pair of whistleblower attorneys and has said he plans to file a complaint with the Health and Human Services inspector general. Bright does not have access to email any longer and has not been given any details on the role at the National Institutes of Health, two sources familiar with the matter said. <br><br>Through his attorneys, Bright said he wants the inspector general to \"investigate the manner in which this Administration has politicized the work of BARDA and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections as well as efforts that lack scientific merit.\" <br><br>But there is technically no permanent official in that role. Christi Grimm, who has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations since 1999, became principal deputy earlier this year. She took over for Joanne Chiedi, the acting inspector general who retired last year. Chiedi replaced Dan Levinson, the former inspector general who resigned last year. Trump clashed with Grimm after she published a report this month detailing shortages in hospitals across the country.  <br><br>Amid the back-and-forth of allegations, one clear picture has emerged: that of a top government scientist repeatedly clashing with his politically appointed leaders, including his direct superior Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. That feud worsened in recent months as BARDA and Kadlec's division worked on everything from the development of vaccines and therapeutics to the supplies of medical equipment and personal protective equipment for hospital workers. <br><br>But in a Tuesday evening email to BARDA staff obtained by CNN, Kadlec sought to paper over any discord, framing Bright's departure as a \"new professional challenge,\" congratulating him on his leadership at BARDA and saying he would be \"instrumental in the effort to accelerate the development of Covid-19 diagnostics\" in his new role. <br><br>\"If you haven't seen and I included below an editorial in today's Washington Post written by Senators Alexander and Blunt,\" Kadlec said, referring to an editorial by the senators proposing a \"Shark Tank\" effort to increase coronavirus testing. \"We look forward to Rick's role as the chief shark in the 'Shark Tank' of diagnostics. We all wish Rick well and know his success will be ours and the whole Nation's.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "144", "title": "How Fauci and Birx got Trump to listen to science"}]}, "34": {"title": "Is the insect apocalypse really upon us? It's complicated, say researchers", "content": "Bumble bees are struggling. Fireflies are no longer lighting up the night, and fewer butterflies are fluttering over fields.   <br><br>Several recent reports have warned of a crushing decline in insect populations that could have a catastrophic effect on our environment and food supply. <br><br>However, a new study that's been described as the largest and most comprehensive assessment to date of insect and arachnid populations paints a much more nuanced picture. It suggested that while some might be in peril, an insect apocalypse isn't upon us quite yet.  <br><br>At the same time, researchers said the study is by no means complete, and there is an urgent need to ramp up the study of insect populations to gather more data.  <br><br>While insects that live on land are declining at 9% per decade (0.92% a year), which is a much smaller percentage than suggested by other studies, the study found that there's been an increase of freshwater insects, like midges and mayflies, of 11% per decade. That could be as a result of efforts to clean up the water supply.  <br><br>\"Insect populations are like logs of wood that are pushed under water. They want to come up, while we keep pushing them further down. But we can reduce the pressure so they can rise again,\" said Roel van Klink, a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) and Leipzig University. <br><br>\"The freshwater insects have shown us this is possible. It's just not always easy to identify the causes of declines, and thus the most effective measures to reverse them. And these may also differ between locations.\" <br><br>The study, which published in the journal Science on Thursday, looked at 166 long-term surveys conducted across 1,676 sites worldwide.   <br><br>Trends were highly variable, with differences not only between regions but also areas of study that were close together.  <br><br>'Critically understudied' <br><br>One of the first studies to signal the doom -- spurring reports of insect Armageddon -- came in 2017 when data from nature reserves in western Germany suggested that flying insects had declined by 75% over 27 years.  <br><br>A review published in 2019 indicated that 40% of insect species could become extinct in the next few decades, with insect biomass projected to decline by a staggering 2.5% a year. That figure was quoted in other reports on the topic.  <br><br>One of the reasons studying insect populations is so difficult is that there are more of them than any other type of animal on the planet  -- there's said to be more ladybug species than mammals. So it's typically only the charismatic or commercially or medically important insects like butterflies, bees and mosquitoes that get studied.     <br><br>What's more, because of their short life spans and population dynamics, insect populations are naturally highly variable, which presents a challenge for quantifying long-term trends, noted researchers Maria Dornelas of University of St. Andrews and Gergana Daskalova of the University of Edinburgh in commentary accompanying the study. <br><br>\"The phrase 'insect Armageddon' has captured the collective attention and shined a spotlight on one of the most numerous and diverse groups of organisms on the planet. Yet, insects are critically understudied,\" they wrote.  <br><br>Even though it's the largest survey to date, this latest study's authors said the data they had used still had limitations. Existing research has focused on Europe and the United States, and the study had much less information on the outlook in Africa, South America and South Asia.  <br><br>Data from protected areas and reserves was also more readily available, van Klink said. That means that locations where human land use is most intensive, and therefore where the strongest effects on insect trends might be expected, were underrepresented. <br><br>Given that the vast majority of insects are terrestrial, University of Sussex professor Dave Goulson  said that this new study confirmed what was already clear --  that they have been declining for many decades. <br><br>\"It isn't really at odds with the perception of widespread insect declines -- which is based almost entirely on studies of terrestrial insects (e.g. the German study), and which of course includes the pollinators; bees, butterflies, moths, hoverflies etc,\"  Goulson, who authored a report describing insect declines as a quiet apocalypse, said via email. <br><br>\"The contrasting trends for freshwater presumably reflects the big cleanup of water quality in recent decades, especially in Europe, and this is encouraging, as it suggests that it is possible to undo environmental damage. Unfortunately aquatic insects only make up about 10% of species, the rest being terrestrial,\" he added. <br><br>Wrong impression <br><br>Ultimately, is it really so bad to call it \"insect Armageddon\" if it drives people to change their attitudes toward these creatures from revulsion or fear to trying to help?  Van Klink said the hyperbole isn't helpful.  <br><br>\"I do think it gives a wrong impression of what is happening out here. Our work included vastly more studies than others had. It's a much more nuanced picture,\" he said.  <br><br>\"We need to appreciate the complexity of the problem. There's not an easy solution.\" <br><br>Dornelas and Daskalova said that sensationalizing the problem could potentially catalyze much-needed action in policy development and research. They agreed, however, that fear-based messages often backfire.  <br><br>\"Embracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins. Hope is a more powerful engine of change than fear.\" <br><br>But while the finding of this study was not as dramatic as others, it still confirmed a declining trend.  <br><br>The figure \"0.92% may not sound like much, but in fact it means 24% fewer insects in 30 years' time and 50% fewer over 75 years,\" van Klink said. <br><br>\"Insect declines happen in a quiet way, and we don't take notice from one year to the next. It's like going back to the place where you grew up. It's only because you haven't been there for years that you suddenly realize how much has changed, and all too often not for the better.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "50", "title": "Divisions on battling coronavirus deepen as Trump and Southern states push opening"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "36", "title": "Viruses and other germs: winning a never-ending war"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "142", "title": "Ancient humans are having a moment.

And no, this is not the \"War of the Worlds\" \u2014 it is a war we have been fighting since the beginning of history, and long before.  <br><br>Human history can be described as an everlasting struggle between people and microscopic pathogens, as author and historian William McNeill taught us a generation ago. We are dealing with a deadly, stubborn, and protean set of enemies. Some are viruses, some are bacteria and some are parasites. Each one is different in how they make us sick and how we fight them. <br><br>  <br><br>In 2020 the human race looks vulnerable: global supply chains and travel cause outbreaks in one location to spread worldwide in days, not decades as in the past. Our economy is a highly sophisticated machine that has a difficult time coping on short notice with disasters that few saw coming. <br><br>There is good reason to think that the economy will not fully bounce back until after we have developed an effective vaccine and then scaled up its production to the hundreds of millions of doses we need in the US and billions world-wide. That could take many months, perhaps even a few years. The economic cost is nothing short of mind-boggling, and the social consequences could be chilling. <br><br>And yet, as terrible as it may sound, given the awful death toll, from a longtime perspective, if Covid-19 had to hit us, maybe 2020 is the best time. At least we measure the duration of the devastation in months, not decades. In the past, we were not so lucky. <br><br>Bubonic Plague appeared in Europe in 1347, killed around a third of the population, and stuck around there for centuries, and in Asia even longer.  <br><br>Infectious diseases wiped out much of the population of the American continent after Europeans showed up.

Polio, the great fear of the 1930s and 1940s, took many years to be conquered by the genius of Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin.

In the 20th century, the percentage of people who died of infectious diseases declined to a tiny fraction of what it had been in 1900 (in the US, it plummeted from nearly 800 to about 60 per 100,000 by 1996, a decline of 92.5%)  <br><br>A glance at mortality-by-cause data for the 20th century reveals two things. First, the longtime trend of death by infectious diseases is steeply down: The main causes of death in 1900 were all infectious diseases, whereas in 2019, non-infectious causes dominated and contagious diseases were relegated to the also-ran category.  Second, infectious diseases did not disappear altogether, however, and made deadly if temporary comebacks in 1918 (Spanish flu) and the 1980s (HIV). <br><br> In the end, then, we will see Covid-19 join smallpox, measles, cholera, tuberculosis, and bubonic plague in the graveyard of defeated pathogens. Malaria is not quite there yet, but Bill and Melinda Gates are on the case. Not all of those diseases have quite been eliminated. But when they reappear, it's usually because of humanity's unforced errors. <br><br>The reason is totally obvious: Unlike our forefathers, we know who the enemies are. Think of infectious disease as a tenacious band of killers that never quite disappears but becomes dormant, only to pop up again and again, unexpectedly, in a different guise.  <br><br>For example, Zika, Ebola and swine flu. They are organisms with no consciousness and no agency, programmed by evolution to multiply rapidly and spread if they can: mindless biology imposed on an integrated world.  We cannot let our guards down as we are apt to do, because no two pandemics are alike. The way it works is that we throw things at them that work for a while, then we need to recalibrate. But thanks to modern science, we are getting better and better at this recalibration. So while the war is never-ending, there is little doubt that humans are winning; we have knowledge, they have evolution. Bet on knowledge. <br><br>The scientific response to Covid-19 has been lightning-fast. Within weeks scientists had sequenced its genome and are actively looking for vulnerabilities.  <br><br> It is a matter of (historically) a short time until we find them. What is more, the Covid virus is serving as a \"focusing device\" \u2014 all of a sudden scientists of many stripes are concentrating on one topic. <br><br>History is full of examples in which society \"recognizes\" an urgent problem and sets its best minds upon solving it. As 18th century writer Dr. Samuel Johnson memorably said, \"Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\" One thinks of the urgent need of eighteenth century sailors to determine longitude at sea, the pressing need that Germans had for nitrogen on the eve of World War I, or the concentrated efforts made in Project Manhattan.  <br><br>The best and the brightest are putting their minds to combat Covid-19: to find cheap and reliable tests and in the end the holy grail, a vaccine.  While politicians squabble and point fingers at one another, researchers collaborate, compare, and communicate.   <br><br>  <br><br>Scientists are bringing to the battlefield a set of weapons that would have boggled the minds of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur: they have advanced molecular virology and immunology, computational genomics,  gene-editing technology, sophisticated epidemiological models, unprecedented tools to store and analyze huge data banks, and ultra-powerful microscopes to peek at extremely small things. <br><br>Their arsenal is still far from perfect, as we are becoming painfully aware. But it is a lot better than what they had while fighting the deadly flu of 1918, which killed possibly 100 million people world-wide.The very identification of the influenza virus as the immediate cause of that epidemic did not occur until the 1930s. Human coronaviruses were identified in the mid-1960s.   <br><br> This is a difficult time for humanity on a global scale. Gloom is natural and inevitable. But we should bear in mind that the kind of economic world we have built, founded on knowledge and research, will aim the full power of its mighty artillery on this virus, and sooner rather than later, will zap it too. Until the next one comes around. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "222", "title": "The dangerous morality behind the 'Open it Up' movement"}, {"id": "146", "title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists"}, {"id": "52", "title": "A safer way to get America back to work"}, {"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}]}, "37": {"title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response", "content": "Alarming new signs are emerging that the Trump administration is shunting science aside in the battle against coronavirus. <br><br>In Wednesday's most stunning development, a top administration official working on a vaccine claimed he was ousted after resisting efforts to push unproven drugs promoted by President Donald Trump and his conservative media cheerleaders as \"game changer\" treatments. <br><br>That news was followed by a bewilderingly inconsistent White House briefing. Conflicting messages on when to reboot the economy, the need for testing and the possibility of a resurgence of the virus combined with Trump's effort to suppress facts that jar with his insistence that the end of a nightmare likely to last many more months is near. <br><br>In another bizarre twist, Trump produced Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to walk back his remarks that the coronavirus challenge could be more difficult in the fall.  <br><br>Trump claimed that Redfield had been \"totally misquoted\" by the media. But under questioning from reporters, Redfield confirmed that he had in fact made the remarks that angered Trump. <br><br>\"I'm accurately quoted in The Washington Post,\" he conceded, as Trump countered that the headline was wrong. It accurately described Redfield warning that if a coronavirus resurgence came at the same time as the flu season, hospitals could be overwhelmed. <br><br>The President also openly clashed with his top public health officials on the likelihood of the virus returning for another assault in the fall -- saying only \"embers\" of disease were likely that could be easily put out. <br><br>The President did break with Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, saying he \"strongly disagrees\" with aggressive plans to open businesses including hair salons on Friday as pro-Trump southern states look to ease stay-at-home orders. <br><br>But his rebuke followed days of Trump all but goading southern conservative states to open up, even though many don't yet meet White House opening guidelines. And a source familiar with calls between Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the Georgia governor said that both men expressed support and praise for Kemp's move to reopen businesses. <br><br>Wednesday's show, orchestrated by Trump in his campaign style-briefing, is unlikely to ease fears amid Americans tiring of stay-at-home orders but wary of reemerging into normal life. <br><br>It also exacerbated the consistent impression that the President's fast shifting positions are based more on hunches and his political requirements than a factual reading of the progression of the crisis that is far from abating. <br><br>Top official said he was ousted over Trump-endorsed treatments <br><br>  <br><br>The drama involving Dr. Rick Bright, who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, appeared to be the latest occasion when a senior official who contradicted Trump's pet causes paid with his job. <br><br>Bright claimed he was transferred to another post because of his \"insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address Covid-19 into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.\" <br><br>But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said Bright himself sought out chloroquine, one of the controversial treatment drugs. <br><br>\"As it relates to chloroquine, it was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on Covid-19 patients. The EUA is what made the donated product available for use in combating Covid-19,\" said Caitlin Oakley, deputy assistant secretary at HHS. <br><br>Trump, spent several weeks all but prescribing hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients, saying doctors had little to lose in using a drug not clinically trialed for the disease. A new study however suggests that the therapy might actually harm the prognosis of critically ill patients. <br><br>The President insisted he had nothing to do with Bright's ouster. <br><br>\"I have never heard of him. I don't know who he is,\" Trump insisted. <br><br>In staggeringly frank comments issued through his attorneys, Bright suggested that the leadership of the Health and Human Services Department was not committed to following science and wanted to fund drugs promoted by Trump's political allies. He also claimed the administration tried to broaden the use of hydroxychloroquine in an unsafe manner and may even have endangered lives by pushing the drug, which is typically used to treat lupus and other conditions. <br><br>\"Sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis,\" Bright wrote.\"Rushing blindly towards unproven drugs can be disastrous and result in countless more deaths. Science, in service to the health and safety of the American people, must always trump politics.\" <br><br>Bizarre scene as Redfield walks back his fall warning <br><br>  <br><br>In another episode in which Trump appeared to challenge established fact, the President claimed Redfield had been \"totally misquoted\" by the media. But under questioning from reporters, the CDC chief confirmed that he had in fact made the remarks that angered Trump. <br><br>\"I'm accurately quoted in The Washington Post,\" he said, before complaining about the headline on an article in which he warned if a coronavirus resurgence came at the same time as the flu season, hospitals could be overwhelmed. <br><br>Redfield's appearance, which was awkward to watch as a public servant was openly pressured by a President, appeared to have been ordered because his remarks countered Trump's optimistic pledges that the pandemic is almost over. <br><br>We \"may not even have corona coming back\" Trump said, countering most of the science of pandemics which suggest the disease will circulate until there is a vaccine or sufficient members of the public have been infected to provide herd immunity. <br><br>Trump then asked Dr. Deborah Birx, a senior member of the coronavirus task force \"Dr., wouldn't you say there's a good chance that Covid will not come back?\" <br><br>Birx replied: \"We don't know.\" <br><br>Trump insisted \"we may have some embers, and we're going to put them out -- of corona.\"  <br><br>He refused to explain to reporters why he believed the disease would not come back in the fall. <br><br>Trump undermines Georgia opening <br><br>  <br><br>The President had resisted pressure to rein in Georgia's Kemp, who appeared to respond to Trump's calls for a reopening before May 1 with an aggressive plan. <br><br>But on Wednesday, he reversed course -- in public at least, although the sources familiar with the calls by the President and Pence appeared to indicate that the rebuke may have been more for public consumption than to slow opening. <br><br>\"I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barber shops ... is too soon,\" Trump said, adding that he told Kemp however he had to make his own decisions. <br><br>Trump's row back puts Kemp in a tough political position. But it does provide Trump with some cover if Georgia's plans to open its economy cause a spike in viral infections. <br><br>Kemp appears to be pressing ahead with his plans, though public discomfort with his approach and the President's undercutting of his ally could dampen the extent of the opening. <br><br>\"We will continue with this approach to protect the lives -- and livelihoods -- of all Georgians,\" Kemp tweeted. \"Just like the thousands of businesses currently operating throughout Georgia, I am confident that business owners who decide to reopen will adhere to Minimum Basic Operations, which prioritize the health and well-being of employees and customers.\" <br><br>Fauci's emotional plea <br><br>  <br><br>Wednesday's briefing was notable for the reappearance of Fauci for the first time this week. The veteran infectious disease specialist has not been afraid to bluntly adopt positions that imply strong disagreement with the President's stances. <br><br>\"We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way,\" Fauci said, in registering apparent disapproval of a clutch of southern states that appear to be putting aside White House guidelines that call for states to record a 14-day decline in coronavirus infections before they think of limited openings. <br><br>\"I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, with the people with responsibility, although I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don't do that,\" Fauci said. <br><br>\"Do it in a measured way. This is a successful formula. The problem is, if we don't do that, there is a likelihood that we'll have a rebound. And the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can't take care of,\" he added. <br><br>Several southern states -- including Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and Texas -- appear keen to heed the President's eagerness to open up the economy. That's even though the virus has not receded sufficiently to comply with White House guidelines in some cases. Yet other, harder hit states in the northeast, the Midwest and the West are far from reopening. <br><br>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday he understood the political and economic pressure to reopen. But he warned that states must not make \"stupid\" decisions they might regret. <br><br>CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Kevin Liptak, Jim Acosta and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "144", "title": "How Fauci and Birx got Trump to listen to science"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}]}, "47": {"title": "Every Day is Earth Day: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for April 22", "content": "This year, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day comes in the midst of a pandemic. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to Bill Weir, CNN's chief climate correspondent, about the parallels between Covid-19 and climate change, as well as what it was like for Weir to welcome a new son into the world during such an uncertain time. <br><br>You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below. <br><br>Bill Weir: My dearest River, I'm sorry we broke your sea and your sky. I'm sorry that the Great Barrier Reef is no longer great. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: That's my colleague Bill Weir, CNN's chief climate correspondent. He's reading a letter he wrote to his newborn son, River.  <br><br>Weir: But alas, the milk in your bottle was warmed by dirty ancient fuels, and as a result, you're among the first babies ever to toddle on a planet this warm. We're just now wrestling with the implications of this. But for me, the most poignant evidence is that your mother was forced to give you your first kiss through a P100 mask. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Today is Earth Day. A day for celebrating and appreciating our planet, and embracing the outdoors. But this year, many of us find ourselves stuck indoors, and with very little to celebrate.  <br><br>Coronavirus has upended our lives, but it's also teaching us lessons about ourselves, and our planet. <br><br>I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" <br><br>Dr. Gupta: For this special Earth Day episode, I wanted to ask Bill about the connections between climate and coronavirus. Our conversation though started on a personal note ... the birth of his son 15 days ago.  <br><br>Weir: So grateful to have this little bundle, this nugget of new life and love to focus on in the middle of this nightmare. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: I can only, only imagine. A huge congratulations to you and Kelly. What was the experience like in the hospital? <br><br>Weir: Well you know, they've really sort of sealed off the neonatal and maternity ward to keep it humming regardless of what was going on outside. The coronavirus patients are in a different building. So we came in and we had her in my mask that I used for covering wildfires. It was the only mask I could find. Almost bought one off of eBay for 600 bucks from some profiteer because we were so worried. But then I remembered I had this mask that I used to cover the last round of wildfires. And, you know, she kissed our baby through that mask for the first time, which is sort of a poignant parallel between, you know, climate crisis and the pandemic that we're in right now and how they all relate.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Bill, one thing I just want to make sure we're making clear as well is there is a parallel between all the work you do and report on with regard to climate change and what is happening now with this pandemic. Right? I mean, if it's the infringements on these areas, deforestation ... what is the parallel between this pandemic and climate change?   <br><br>Weir: I think the most obvious one is that for a very long time, very smart scientists said, \"If we're not careful and we cut down all the jungles, we're going to unleash an invisible enemy that's gonna come out of those jungles and get into our lungs.\" But that was a story that few people wanted to hear. And for an even longer time, very smart scientists have been saying, \"If we're not careful, an invisible enemy is going to come out of our factories and our cars and our homes. And it's going to get into the sky and the sea, and it's going to disrupt life as we know it. We're going to lose the ability to predict the weather.\"  <br><br>And that was a story that too few people wanted to believe. And when it comes to the responses, look at the countries that waited until people started dying to act. They're the ones suffering the most. Whereas you look at South Korea, where they have a respect for expertise and a knowledge and a belief that we're all in this together and we can quench this thing. They flatten the curve. I mean, I'm so happy that \"flatten the curve\" is now part of our vernacular because we can do the same thing with climate. Whether that's a global effort of the smartest people around the world cooperating to either find a vaccine for this particular virus, or to come up with a way to power our lives in a clean, sustainable way.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: It is hard to believe that we're sort of in this self-quarantine on Earth Day. I mean, no matter how good your predictive skills are, I think very few people would have been able to predict that.  <br><br>Weir: It was predicted! ... You know, there are just as, maybe not as many, scientists who've been warning about climate change for over a century. We've had virus hunters saying this was a very real hazard. But again, we're just not wired to think in these terms, I think. You know, we evolved to fear the noise behind the bush and try to figure out, \"Is that a stick or a snake?\" And we think about immediate threats, and time rubs the edges off of our fear. It's a reminder that when our smartest scientists say, \"Something really bad could happen, if we're not careful\" -- we should probably pay attention to that and certainly not politicize that.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: There's been a lot of pictures, and you see how quick things change in terms of the impact in the acute environment at least. The air's a little cleaner. There's the birds that are chirping in Wuhan, which I guess hadn't happened in a while. We get to see what happens when human activities on the planet come to somewhat of a halt. What does that teach us about the human impact on the environment?   <br><br>Weir: Well, I think it teaches us just how much the human footprint is literally on everything. You know, that we have paved and plowed and developed so much of the Earth and there's so few places left, you know, where the wild things are. And, you know, creatures and ecosystems that took millions of years to settle into a harmonious balance. We have absolutely upended within a blink of Earth time. But they can bounce back if you give them space. There's this thing called the \"sliding baseline syndrome,\" which is that, you know, you walk on a beach and with your kid and you say, \"Man, when I was a boy, the stars, the Milky Way, it was incredible.\" He doesn't know what you're talking about. What he knows is what he can see, and so when he teaches his kids, the baseline has moved. Well, now that we've sort of reversed it for a brief moment in time and can show our kids, \"That's what the Milky Way looks like.\" <br><br>Dr. Gupta: It is human psychology, I guess, to some extent, and maybe it's the way that we are wired for good reason, that acute threats are the things that we're gonna pay most attention to. But if the rock isn't about to hit me in the face, I'm probably not going to worry about it as much. How do you get the messages across? Because I think there's a lot of parallels here.  <br><br>Weir: Yeah, I mean, when it comes to a pandemic, the most extreme measures you take will seem over the top before it happens and will seem, you know, completely inadequate after the fact. And it's kind of the same with climate. That will mean everything has to change. Everything. Transportation, construction, our food supply, geopolitics, economics. And that's such a seismic thing to a species that sort of likes things the way they are. That's such a big ask. And if we do all of those things, it will seem excessive. But if we don't do those things, it's going to change anyway.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: I'm wondering, Bill, for you, I'm sure talking to people who fully understand what you're saying. You talk to people who are flat out denying it. And then there are people in between who say, \"I don't disagree with you, but it seems like the cat's out of the bag here. We're never getting that cat back in the bag.\" How do you have those conversations with people, especially with regard to the inevitability? <br><br>Weir: Yes, I think we have to be honest and you have to prepare our children for what's coming. If we could go back in time, six months, wouldn't we prepare our kids for this lockdown? Wouldn't we prepare them for saying goodbye to grandma for the last time? All of those sorts of things.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, Bill, I think about our own childhood. I think we're around the same age. I don't really remember talking about climate change that much when I was a kid. No wars, good economy, no existential threat hanging over our heads, and obviously no pandemic. Not like this. And you're bringing a child into the world. I have kids who, their world has been defined by these things. I just wonder how do you think about that? I've been thinking about that a lot as a dad lately.   <br><br>Weir: Yeah. No, I, believe me, especially in lockdown and staring into his little eyes during those midnight feedings. And you know, best scientists in the world say, \"Life as we know it is at risk if we don't change our ways within a decade.\" And people scoff and say, \"Well, the end of the world!\" Yeah, well, like it's all going to explode on one Saturday afternoon. No, the planet will spin on. We're seeing how life can come back if you leave it alone. It's us that's at risk. It's life as we know it. It's the modern world that's built on predictable growing seasons and supply chains and flight schedules. And this is sort of what I think is a dry run for what my child's life is going to look like, only in hyper lapse, in hyper speed. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Bill, you and I have been doing this job for a long time. And I'm reminded after disasters and even conflicts that, people forget. They move back to the way it was. Will this be different, do you think?  <br><br>Weir: That's such a good question. You know, I think I'm worried that there's such a thing called \"revenge pollution,\" that when a country like China has to shut down manufacturing, once they ramp back up, they, they go double time. They run the smokestacks 24/7. You know, the thing is, ultimately, while you can see the stars and people saying, \"Oh, this might help fix our crisis.\" It won't. I would love to think that this is a wake-up call for these 7 billion-plus people on the planet. I'm afraid not. And I think it's going to take real leadership. And to solve the problem of climate demands such cooperation, both from allies and enemies. And unfortunately, Covid is the crisis that makes us all wear masks and has made the handshake obsolete when we need human connection more than ever. But I hope we understand that our relationship with this big blue marble, you know, every day is Earth Day. Every day is Earth Day. We exist at great peril if we forget that.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: The other day, I caught one of my teenage daughters getting up really early in the morning, and she loves to sleep, so I wasn't sure what was going on. But it turns out she wanted to watch the sunrise, since the skies have been unusually clear, thanks to the shutdown. <br><br>I wish my daughters lived in a world where the skies were always clear, and not just a rare sight. <br><br>Right now, we're seeing people around the world make sacrifices and unite against a common enemy. And it's frightening, for sure, but I also find it inspiring. Just shows what we can accomplish when we all work together.  <br><br>Hopefully we can do the same to save our Earth and give our children a better future.  <br><br>You can watch Bill's new documentary \"The Road to Change\" on CNN this Saturday. <br><br>We'll be back tomorrow.

It comes as anxiety that the pandemic is nowhere near over is being exacerbated by a warning from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Robert Redfield that the pandemic could be much worse next winter.  <br><br>The mishmash is likely to do little to instill confidence in a populace that polls show is mostly skeptical about emerging from their homes. And that confidence will be vital to triggering the economic rebound everybody wants. <br><br>Trump, with a clear eye on his reelection prospects, keeps implying that normal life and a swift end to the terrible economic deprivation sparked by the virus are around the corner. <br><br>\"We are opening up America again. Twenty states representing 40% of the population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future,\" the President said at the White House. <br><br>\"We can't break our country over this. We have to get going,\" he said, on a day when US Covid-19 deaths rose to more than 44,000. <br><br>The widening divide was first provoked by Georgia's aggressive move to revive businesses like nail and hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors on Friday, despite not yet achieving compliance with White House blueprints for when it is safe to open up. <br><br>An expanding coalition of Southern, conservative states led by governors who broadly support Trump is now emerging. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said he had spoken with other Southern governors on what reopening would look like. <br><br>\"All of us are of similar minds. We each have different circumstances and different situations that are unique to each individual state,\" Reeves said. <br><br>\"And so I'm not at all surprised that this is sort of exactly what I anticipated occurring with some in the South, continuing to work to reopen.\" <br><br>Trump is doing nothing to slow the Southern coalition. In fact, he appears to be providing inspiration for governors who show signs of putting ideology over science, ignoring inconvenient facts and scientific data in their plans to open up in a desire to please conservative media cheerleaders -- in a case of trickle-down Trumpism.  <br><br>The Southern group's instincts contrast with several bipartisan blocks of states in the Northeast, Midwest and the West that are more cautious and are extending shutdowns -- prolonging an economic collapse that has cost many millions of jobs.  <br><br>Health experts worry about reopening plans <br><br>The South's aggressive approach reflects Trump's enthusiasm for reigniting the economy. But it is dismaying public health experts, who fear that premature easing of shutdowns will cause a new spike in infections even before the initial wave is under control.  <br><br>Such warnings fuel an impression that political considerations are paramount. The zeal for opening does not appear to meet the test set by the government's top infectious disease specialist, Anthony Fauci, that the \"virus will decide\" when it's safe to reopen. Fauci was absent from Trump's briefing again on Tuesday. <br><br>Patrice Harris, the president of the American Medical Association, said she was worried about a possible second wave of infections in the fall on the lines of Redfield's warning to The Washington Post. <br><br>\"I'm also worried about a second wave to come sooner. I'm really worried about those states who are relaxing some of the stay-at-home regulations earlier. We could get a second wave even earlier than the fall. That's very concerning,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. <br><br>The best-case scenario following aggressive reopening in Southern states, in contrast with more hard-hit epicenters in the North like New York and Michigan, is that it could create test cases of how to reignite the economy while keeping the disease at bay. That would require most warnings by medical and public health experts to be wrong. <br><br>So opening up now is a huge risk. Just because the curve of infections is flattened does not mean it cannot rise again since the disease has no proven therapies and there is so far no vaccine. <br><br>The Trump administration's failure to institute a national testing infrastructure makes the openings even more of a risk, since an accurate fix on the pandemic's penetration in the states is impossible. The testing deficit complicates the task of diagnosing, tracing and isolating infected patients and those exposed. <br><br>Trump, however, is dismissing academic studies that show millions of tests must be completed every day nationwide to ensure that the process of restoring the economy is safe. <br><br>\"Not everybody wants to do such significant testing. Testing is good in some cases. And in some cases it's not,\" Trump argued in a statement that was neither accurate nor rooted in fact. <br><br>\"You have governors that don't want to go all out on the testing, because they think they can do it in a different manner and do it better,\" the President said. <br><br>Trump defends Georgia governor <br><br>With Georgia under fire from within and outside the state, Trump defended Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, and said he would speak to him by telephone later on Tuesday. <br><br>\"He is a very capable man. He knows what he is doing,\" the President said. <br><br>Dr. Deborah Birx, a senior member of Trump's task force on coronavirus, appeared to be walking a political tightrope beside the President, not directly criticizing Kemp but hinting apparent disapproval of the return of businesses like salons. <br><br>\"If there's a way that people can social distance and do those things, then they can do those things. I don't know how. But people are very creative. So I'm not going to prejudge,\" Birx said. <br><br>Trump also further undermined the notion of social distancing when he said, falsely, that conservative protesters demanding reopening were keeping their distance from one another. <br><br>He implicitly rebuked CDC Director Redfield, who had earlier said that such demonstrations were \"not helpful.\" <br><br>\"It's not a question of helpful or not. People want to get back to work. And I've watched some of the protests, not in great detail, but I've seen that, and they're separated.\" Television pictures of the protests suggest Trump is not being truthful. <br><br>The nature of the US political system, the size of the country and the differences in the intensity of the virus from place to place mean that there is not and should not be a one-size-fits-all method of reopening. <br><br>But the fact that so many officials are willing to shrug off White House guidelines that stipulate a 14-day downward track of infections before opening is contemplated and, in many cases, the concerns of health experts and other local leaders, is threatening widespread confusion. <br><br>For instance, in Texas, Dallas County extended its stay-at-home orders until May 15. But Gov. Greg Abbott said that if he orders business to open next week, his authority would take precedence. <br><br>One Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he backed the decision by his home state of South Carolina to reopen beaches and some stores but was concerned about events across the border. <br><br>\"I worry that our friends and neighbors in Georgia are going too fast too soon,\" Graham wrote on Twitter. <br><br>Columbia's Democratic Mayor Stephen Benjamin warned that decisions being made by governors like the Palmetto state's Henry McMaster were not based on sound science. <br><br>\"The challenge is in places like Florida and Georgia and, yes, even here in South Carolina there is not that dialogue that is data-focused rather than these arbitrary dates our governors keep laying out,\" Benjamin said on CNN. <br><br>\"The goal ought to be to reopen a pandemic-resistant or a pandemic-free economy.\" <br><br>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a strong supporter of the President, ordered his reopening task force to work out how to minimize risk as businesses open. <br><br>The curve does appear to be flattening in Florida, but the state still reported more than 800 new cases on Tuesday, for a total of nearly 28,000 diagnosed infections and more than 860 deaths. <br><br>In a Trumpian flourish, DeSantis lashed out at the media, which he said had created narratives that \"Florida's about to be capsized by this flood of sick people and it doesn't happen. Then people need to realize that a lot of what was said there has not been proven to be true.\" <br><br>There was evidence of more Trump-style spur-of-the-moment decision-making when it was revealed that Georgia's Kemp didn't tell members of his Covid-19 task force Monday before making his sweeping announcement on reopening. <br><br>In a Facebook video, Bernice King, co-chair of the task force, said she had found out about the Georgia governor's intention via text message from a friend. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "222", "title": "The dangerous morality behind the 'Open it Up' movement"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}]}, "52": {"title": "A safer way to get America back to work", "content": "chulze, MD, PhD is the chief executive officer of Lifetrack Medical Systems (LMS), a medical software and health tech company.

View more opinion articles on CNN. <br><br> (CNN)The novel coronavirus, like all other viruses, has a specific biology based on its genetic material. <br><br>It expresses particular proteins that have a targeted point of entry into human cells, in this case the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor -- and this has led to some very unusual biology. <br><br>Initially, to limit the spread of disease during this pandemic, the right approach was to use a blunt force instrument: the \"sledgehammer\" of population-wide community quarantine.  <br><br>This gave scientists and doctors the time to study this virus and try to unlock its secrets. Now, after months of research, we know a little bit more about how this virus functions -- and with emerging data -- who is more at risk of falling seriously ill from the virus.  <br><br>We are starting to understand why some people are at a higher risk from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. <br><br>We may be able to use this knowledge to inform us how to start getting those who are at a lower risk back to work and normal life.  <br><br>The comorbidity factor <br><br>Early on in the outbreak, the data started to show some unusual patterns. The virus could be deadly for the elderly but seemed uninterested in children. Additionally, hypertension was found to be one comorbidity, which is the simultaneous presence of two diseases or conditions in a patient. This is atypical for an infectious disease; for example, we don't target people with hypertension as being at great risk for the flu.  <br><br>Then, in March, a study from the Instituto Superiore Di Sanita in Italy revealed that 99% of coronavirus fatalities in Italy had comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and hepatic disease or additionally having immunosuppression of any type. The study was the first to detail this connection.   <br><br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on preliminary US data, has reported that \"persons with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for severe Covid-19--associated disease than persons without these conditions.\"  <br><br>It was also noted that people over 60 were at much greater risk of dying than the young.  <br><br>That age was a risk factor was not unusual as it nearly always is a risk factor -- but age risk usually applies to both ends of the age spectrum.  <br><br>Covid-19 affects young people ages 19 and under at significantly lower rates than other age groups. It was starting to seem that the elderly were more at risk because they had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. This explanation better fits the data and explained why so few young people were falling ill while the elderly were affected in greater numbers. <br><br>Age, it seemed, is not an independent risk factor, but rather an association. <br><br>Expanding our understanding <br><br>As we started focusing on these unusual epidemiological motifs through our practice and research, we were also starting to learn more and more about the cell and molecular biology of this virus, in particular its targeting of the human ACE2 receptor which allows it to enter into the cell. <br><br>This receptor is part of the body system that helps maintain normal blood pressure. Because this virus might do its worst damage to those organs most intimately involved in this system -- namely the lungs, heart and kidneys --  it is no surprise that it may target those patients with related diseases.  <br><br>The preliminary incoming data continues to build on the thesis. A study of patients in New York City showed obesity to be a risk factor among individuals who sought medical attention at NYU Langone. <br><br>Another study at NYU found that among patients under 60, those with obesity were twice as likely to need hospitalization. A clear pattern seems to be emerging: not only does this virus appear to be targeting with diseases of the organ systems well known to be intimately related to ACE2 receptors, but it also seems to be targeting the obese where ACE2 can also be a factor. <br><br>Soon after the two of us started to suspect there was a connection between obesity and Covid-19, a paper from the UK Intensive Care National Audit Center (ICNARC) came out detailing the ICU experience for patients in the UK. The ICNARC report showed those with a Body Mass Index over 30, which is considered obese, made up 37.7% of the confirmed cases of Covid-19. <br><br>Its data was consistent with identifying obesity as a significant comorbidity for this virus, especially with respect to who is most at risk for needing ICU admission if infected.  <br><br>To further punctuate this linkage, Professor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delfraissy, the chief epidemiologist for France, also warned that overweight and obese people could be at risk.   <br><br>In fact, given patient demographics in the US, this could be the most common of the comorbidities in the young as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes (adult onset) and chronic lung, kidney or liver disease are illnesses of middle aged and the elderly.  <br><br>Applying what we know <br><br>A primary reason for the current global panic is that a consolidated approach to managing this pandemic has eluded us. While disparate groups have noted the presence of comorbidities, the scientific community has not made any unified conclusions so far.  <br><br>Based on what we've been able to observe in patients so far, the at-risk population seems to be largely those with specific comorbidities related to the ACE2 receptor, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and chronic lung, liver and kidney disease, as well as obesity. <br><br>Additional risk groups that have been identified are the immunocompromised for any reason. So, it is these vulnerable at-risk groups that we must take extra precautions to safeguard from this virus. <br><br>Considering the data, we can begin to think about this virus differently. It is not like the seasonal flu which broadly affects a population. Based on the information to date, we believe that this virus is more focused, which causes great concern, particularly for those in an at-risk group. <br><br>But we can also view the highly targeted nature of this virus as its Achilles' heel. We are developing a sharper picture of who it is targeting and can begin to deduce who we as a society need to protect.  <br><br>Rather than continuing to use a sledgehammer plan to defeat this virus, there may be wisdom in using a scalpel: a targeted approach that shelters the vulnerable and clearly delineates who is not at risk. This could create a path for reentry into normal life in a carefully structured manner. <br><br>Reviving the economy <br><br>If economic activity remains curtailed for an extended period of time, the impact will be felt by companies and local, county, state and federal governments. Countless employees have been laid off, businesses have been shuttered and in-person spending has all but halted. <br><br>Even when we are told that things are \"normal\" and that we can go out and spend money, if left for too late, the aggregate demand will simply not be there. <br><br>A mechanic, who has been out of work for months, upon finding work again will first focus on paying off his debts. Then he will focus on building up a bigger savings buffer than he thought he needed before. This means that he is going to take a long time to get back to being the same type of active consumer he was in January 2020.  Multiply this reality across the income spectrum of working American families and it is clear that demand will take a while to pick up.  <br><br>One can only speculate on the kind of burden this puts on the structure of society and the risks it exposes for the population. <br><br>At this point, instead of \"flattening the curve,\" -- which is important to note does not save lives, it merely prolongs the time it takes for the vulnerable to get sick and die -- it is maybe more prudent to specifically protect the vulnerable and keep them safe until we either have a vaccine or a cure.  <br><br>Meanwhile, we should begin to consider letting the rest of the population resume some activity. We can do this safely if we remember that the Achilles' heel of this virus is its targeting of a specific profile of people who are vulnerable in our country -- people we as a society can protect -- and use our innovation to serve. <br><br>Given the low risk of severe or critical Covid-19 infections in those people without comorbidities, it would seem that this group could be allowed to return to work in a phased manner adjusted for risk and age -- of course, with sustained focus on rigorous hygiene, wearing face masks and continuous assessment of the effects of de-quarantining. <br><br>This method could beat the results of \"flattening the curve\" because we are now specifically shielding the at-risk groups while healing the economy before that becomes a comorbidity for all of us. <br><br>Given the prevalence of the comorbidities in the US population, this would be a contentious message. It would, however, mean that a significant section of the workforce could go back to work relatively soon and we would have a chance at patching the hole in the economy before the damage is irreparable. <br><br>It is imperative that at the very least, we should start this conversation now. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}, {"id": "222", "title": "The dangerous morality behind the 'Open it Up' movement"}]}, "56": {"title": "This is where all 50 states stand on reopening", "content": "More than 97% of the US population is currently under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order as the coronavirus pandemic continues to upend life as we know it. But worries for the economy -- and people's mental health -- are raising the question: When will things go back to normal? <br><br>President Donald Trump has indicated many states can reopen by May 1, and on Thursday shared federal guidelines for restarting the economy with governors.  <br><br>Across the country, governors have been forming pacts. Those leaders are highlighting the importance of using science and advice from health officials rather than politics to choose when to reopen the economy. Expanded testing, tracking contacts of people who had the virus, improved treatment options and vaccine development are important, they say.  <br><br>Here's the latest on where states stand in their plan to reopen: <br><br>Alabama <br><br>Gov. Kay Ivey issued a stay-at-home order set to expire on April 30.  <br><br>Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth announced the formation of a task force to reopen the state's economy. It is scheduled to report its suggestions to the governor on April 22. <br><br>Ivey said April 14 she intends to work with other states and the Trump administration, but that \"what works in Alabama works in Alabama.\"  <br><br>When the economy starts to reopen, Ivey said during a press briefing it will be a slow process over time, \"segment by segment or region by region.\" <br><br>Alaska <br><br>Gov. Mike Dunleavy has ordered residents to stay at home until April 21. <br><br>Dunleavy has said that Alaskans can again schedule elective surgeries for on or after May 4 and visit their doctors for non-urgent needs.  <br><br>Arizona <br><br>Gov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order that will expire on April 30.  <br><br>\"I want to get the economy moving and people back to work as soon as possible -- when it is safe and healthy for people to do so,\" Ducey said on Twitter on April 13. <br><br>The governor emphasized the importance of maintaining social distancing and continuing to make \"responsible choices.\" <br><br>\"It's critical that we keep those efforts up as we plan for the future and a time when we can begin to return some normalcy to people's lives,\" Ducey said. <br><br>Arkansas <br><br>Gov. Asa Hutchinson has not issued a stay-at-home order. <br><br>Schools will be closed for the rest of the academic term. Fitness centers, bars, restaurants and other public spaces are closed until further notice.  <br><br>Hutchinson told reporters on April 16 that he wants to bring back elective surgeries. \"We want to get (hospitals) back to doing the important health-care delivery that is important in our communities,\" he said. <br><br>California <br><br>Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19 that has no set end date. <br><br>Newsom announced a joint Western States Pact with Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on April 13.  <br><br>\"Health outcomes and science -- not politics -- will guide these decisions\" to reopen the states, according to a joint statement from the governors. <br><br>Newsom outlined a framework for reopening the economy in the Golden State on Tuesday that he said was predicated on the state's ability to do six things: expand testing to identify and isolate the infected, maintain vigilance to protect seniors and high risk individuals, be able to meet future surges in hospitals with a \"myriad of protective gear,\" continue to collaborate with academia on therapies and treatments, redraw regulations to ensure continued physical distancing at businesses and schools and develop new enforcement mechanisms to allow the state to pull back and reinstate stay-at-home orders. <br><br>\"I know you want the timeline, but we can't get ahead of ourselves and dream of regretting. Let's not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to,\" Newsom said. <br><br>\"I know you want the timeline, but we can't get ahead of ourselves ... Let's not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to,\" Newsom said. <br><br>Colorado <br><br>Gov. Jared Polis extended the state's stay-at-home order, which now remains in effect until April 26. <br><br>He said April 15 that the key information state officials need to determine when parts of the economy can be reopened is likely to come within the next five days. <br><br>The governor warned that restrictions won't all be lifted at the same time, and life will be different for some time.  \"The virus will be with us,\" Polis said. \"We have to find a sustainable way that will be adapted in real time to how we live with it.\" <br><br>Connecticut <br><br>Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont extended the mandatory shutdown in the state until May 20. <br><br>Connecticut has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a news release from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.  <br><br>Lamont said he believed it would take at least another month before the state could decide on how and when to open things back up and emphasized \"this is no time to relax.\"  <br><br>Looking to revive the state's economy, Lamont announced Thursday the formation of the \"Reopen Connecticut Advisory Board.\" <br><br>Delaware <br><br>Gov. John Carney issued a statewide stay-at-home order that will remain until May 15 or until the \"public health threat is eliminated.\" <br><br>Delaware has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,  and Rhode Island to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office. The governor said April 17 that once the state reopens, social distancing, face coverings in public, washing hands, limited gatherings and vulnerable populations sheltering in place will remain. <br><br>District of Columbia <br><br>Washington, DC Mayor Muriel E. Bowser extended a stay-at-home order  until May 15. <br><br>\"I don't know if that means we will be open on May 16, but it will be a point for us to check in. And if we need to extend it beyond that, we certainly will,\" Bowser said during April 15 media briefing.  <br><br>Florida <br><br>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for Floridians until April 30.  <br><br>DeSantis plans to announce his reopening plan for the state of Florida next week, he said April 16.  <br><br>During a news conference Thursday, he suggested it could start with allowing elective surgeries. <br><br>DeSantis said he will meet April 17 with a task force that includes experts across various industries throughout the state.  <br><br>Southeast Florida, which is the epicenter of the outbreak in the state, could be treated differently than other parts, the governor said. <br><br>Georgia <br><br>Gov. Brian Kemp issued a statewide shelter-in-place order that runs until April 30. The governor also extended the public health emergency through May 13. All K-12 public schools will remain closed through the end of the school year. <br><br>Kemp on April 20 announced the incremental reopening of certain businesses as early as April 24, incuding gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, hair and nail salons, estheticians and massage therapists. Theaters and restaurants can reopen on April 27.  <br><br>Bars, nightclubs and music venues will remain closed. The openings will be statewide, and local ordinances can't restrict them. All businesses that reopen must adhere to best practices, including social distancing and screening employees for illness.  <br><br>Kemp had previously emphasized the importance of expanding testing before reopening the state.  <br><br>\"We're a little behind the curve from when our peak is going to be to other states around the country,\" Kemp said during an April 13 press briefing. \"That is certainly a day I am ready for, but I think today specifically we have been focused on the surge capacity, ramping up testing to do more than we're doing.\" <br><br>Hawaii <br><br>Gov.  David Ige issued a stay-at-home order for Hawaii residents which will last through at least April 30.  <br><br>He said Thursday the state doesn't satisfy the federal criteria for phased reopening, one of which is a 14-day downward trend in the number of cases. \"We're making progress, but we're not there yet, so please continue your hard work and perseverance, we will get through this together,\" he said. <br><br>Idaho <br><br>Gov. Brad Little amended his order April 15 to allow for some businesses and facilities to reopen for curbside pickup, drive-in and drive-thru service and for mailed or delivery services. It is now effective through the end of the month.  <br><br>The governor issued an \"Order to Self-Isolate\" which will expire on April 30 unless extended. <br><br>Little said that the measures were working and Idaho is \"truly seeing a flattening of the curve.\" <br><br>\"Our goal is for most businesses to open after the end of the month, but with the understanding that it may not be possible if there's an upward trend in severe Covid-19 cases in Idaho between now and then,\" Little said. <br><br>Illinois <br><br>Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order through at least April 30. <br><br>Pritzker said during a media briefing Monday that he believes the current state in Illinois has been enough to slowly start lifting shelter-in-place orders so that some industry workers can go back to work.  <br><br>Although there is no clear time line, he hopes that restarting production will go \"industry by industry, and maybe company by company.\" <br><br>On April 15 when asked about possibly extending the order into May he said: \"We're continuing to (consult health officials) and we'll be making announcements about our decisions over the next several days.\" <br><br>Indiana <br><br>Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 17 extended the stay-at-home order through May 1.  <br><br>The extension will give the state additional time to look into what the best way is to reopen sectors of the economy, Holcomb said. He said he would work with the state hospital association to see when elective surgeries could resume. <br><br>Indiana is part of a Midwest coalition of states looking at reopening possibilities <br><br>Iowa <br><br>Gov. Kim Reynolds has not declared a stay-at-home order. Reynolds issued a State of Public Health Disaster Emergency on March 17, ordering all nonessential businesses to close until April 30. <br><br>The governor formed an Iowa economic recovery task force consisting of state leaders and private business leaders and announced plans to discuss with education leaders about the possibility of reopening schools. <br><br>Reynolds on April 16 announced that residents of the region of the state with the most cases, where there was an outbreak at a food processing plant, cannot get together until April 30.  <br><br>\"You may gather only with members or your immediate household,\" Reynolds said, adding there were a few exceptions like religious services with 10 worshippers or fewer. <br><br>Kansas <br><br>Gov. Laura Kelly issued a stay-at-home order, which has been extended until May 3. <br><br>The initial order was set to expire April 19. <br><br>Kelly said Kansas expects to see its peak of coronavirus cases between April 19-29, based on projections. <br><br>Kentucky <br><br>Gov. Andy Beshear issued a \"Healthy at Home\" orde March 25 that is in effect indefinitely.  <br><br>Kentucky is working with six other states to coordinate reopening measures. <br><br>The governor said April 16 it will be a phased-in approach \"where we can have that that symbiotic bump ... to make sure that the steps that we take ultimately have a bigger reward or bigger output, because they are being replicated in other areas that we already do so much business with.\" <br><br>Louisiana <br><br>Gov. John Bel Edwards extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30. <br><br>The governor announced on April 16 the formation of an economic recovery task force. <br><br>\"They're going to look at our economy, make recommendations to make our businesses more resilient so that we can open them up, get businesses open, get workers back to work, but do so in a way that adequately affects public health,\" he said. <br><br>Maine <br><br>Gov. Janet Mills issued a \"Stay Healthy at Home\" executive order through at least April 30. Mills extended the state's civil state of emergency until May 15. <br><br>\"We are in the midst of one of the greatest public health crises this world has seen in more than a century,\" Mills said in a news release. \"This virus will continue to sicken people across our state; our cases will only grow, and more people will die. I say this to be direct, to be as honest with you as I can. Because saving lives will depend on us.\" <br><br>Mills said she wished she didn't have to extend the state of emergency, but \"the continued spread of the virus demands a sustained response by the State.\"  <br><br>Maine is in touch with neighbors New Hampshire and Vermont on reopening measures, the governor said April 14. <br><br>Maryland <br><br>Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 30. There is no current potential end date.  <br><br>The governor said during his appearance on CNN Newsroom on April 13 that the state is discussing ways to safely reopen the state with health officials, and that his priority is to save lives, not the economy. <br><br>\"We've got to listen to the doctors and scientists,\" Hogan said. \"We've also got to be concerned about people getting the help they need and getting on track, but doing so in a gradual and safe manner when it's really the right time to do it.\" <br><br>Hogan said a cooperation amongst other governors on when to reopen the states would be a \"good idea.\" <br><br>People in Maryland will be required to wear face coverings in stores and on public transportation as of April 18.  <br><br>Massachusetts <br><br>Gov. Charlie Baker issued an emergency order requiring all nonessential businesses to close facilities until May 4. <br><br>Massachusetts has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.  <br><br>Baker told residents of his state that officials have begun conversations around reopening the state but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before a plan is set into motion.  <br><br>The state will need to have testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine procedures in place to reopen, the governor said. <br><br>\"I think it's going to be really important that we all pay attention to what the others are up to, and to make sure that nobody does anything that puts somebody in a really bad spot, because they just weren't thinking about what that impact was going to be on some other part of the Northeastern part of the US,\" he said. <br><br>Michigan <br><br>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30. <br><br>Whitmer said during Monday's press briefing that reopening the state's economy will be based on a \"data-driven approach based on facts, based on science, based on recommendations from experts.\" <br><br>The four factors the governor will take into consideration before reopening Michigan include a sustained reduction in cases, expanded testing and tracing capabilities, sufficient healthcare capacity, and the best practices for the workplace. <br><br>At the end of week that saw a protest at the Capitol and an anti-Whitmer tweet from Trump, the governor said April 17: \"There's no one I think is more eager to start reengaging sectors of our economy than I am. But the last thing I want to do is to have a second wave here and so we've got to be really smart.\" <br><br>She said the first businesses to reopen will be in low-risk sectors. <br><br>Minnesota <br><br>Gov. Tim Walz extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 3.  <br><br>He also signed an executive order extending the peacetime emergency for an additional 30 days until May 13. <br><br>Walz emphasized the importance of expanding testing and tracing the spread of the virus before opening the state.  <br><br>The governor's plan to open up the economy is to \"test, we have to do contact tracing, and we have to isolate the people who need to be isolated, and this has to be on a massive scale,\" Walz said.    <br><br>Mississippi <br><br>Gov. Tate Reeves has extended a shelter-in-place order to April 27. <br><br>Reeves said April 17 the state will begin relaxing some of the restrictions on nonessential businesses by allowing them to offer services via drive-thru, curbside or delivery.  <br><br>Reeves has said the state needed to open things back up as quickly and as responsibly as possible. <br><br>\"We know that we will not be able to return to our typical lives right away,\" Reeves said during a media briefing on April 13.  <br><br>\"There are still more sacrifices to be made. We do want to look ahead to opening things up, I know that there are many Mississippians whose lives and livelihoods rely on our ability to get them back to work in a responsible way.\" <br><br>Missouri <br><br>Gov. Mike Parson on April 16 extended the stay-at-home order through May 3.  <br><br>The governor's office said they will work with hospitals, healthcare providers, health officials, and business leaders to develop a reopening plan. <br><br>\"Our reopening efforts will be careful, deliberate, and done in phases,\" he said. <br><br>Montana <br><br>Gov. Steve Bullock extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 24. <br><br>Bullock held a governor's coronavirus task force tele-town hall for Montanans on Monday in which he said following the state's guidelines will allow the state to reopen sooner rather than later.  <br><br>Bullock said he does not know when the stay at home order will be lifted and that while he doesn't \"want to have it in place any longer than what's necessary,\" he is more concerned about completely reopening the state and jeopardizing the work that has been done.  <br><br>Nebraska <br><br>Gov. Pete Ricketts issued the \"21 Days to Stay Home and Stay Healthy\" campaign on April 10. Ricketts ordered that all hair salons, tattoo parlors and strip clubs be closed through April 30 and all organized group sports canceled until May 31.  <br><br>Nebraska is one of the states that has not issued a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of coronavirus nationwide. Ricketts has not made any plans to reopen the state. <br><br>The state's campaign is based on six rules: staying home, socially distancing at work, shopping alone and only once a week, helping kids social distance, helping seniors stay at home and exercising at home.  <br><br>Nevada <br><br>Gov. Steve Sisolak issued a stay-at-home order that expires April 30. <br><br>When asked about how he'd make his decision to reopen the economy, Sisolak said \"positive testing is important but it's not my number one parameter.\" <br><br>\"The things that I look at on a daily basis are hospitalizations, intensive care unit hospitalizations, ventilator usage, and people who pass,\" Sisolak added.  <br><br>He said April 16 that reopening would happen with gradual steps. \"I cannot take the chance of overwhelming our healthcare system,\" he said. <br><br>New Hampshire  <br><br>Gov. Chris Sununu issued a stay-at-home order until May 4.  <br><br>Sununu told reporters on April 16 that he'll decide on whether to extend the order before May 4.   <br><br>\"We want to give people some flexibility and be able to plan,\" Sununu said. He said that applies to restrictions on nonessential businesses and public gatherings. <br><br>All public and private schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year, and students will continue remote learning, he said. <br><br>New Jersey <br><br>Gov. Phil Murphy issued a stay-at-home order on March 21 that has no specific end date.  <br><br>New Jersey has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a news  release from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.  <br><br>\"No one has given more thought or is more eager to restart our economy than I am, but if we don't get the sequencing right, we put more lives at risk. The only path to a sustainable economic recovery is through a strong healthcare recovery,\" Murphy said in a news release.  <br><br>\"A coordinated, regional approach, informed by a multi-state council of experts, will help us avoid a major setback with potentially disastrous consequences.\" <br><br>New Mexico <br><br>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham extended the state's emergency order to April 30. <br><br>She said Thursday her state is evaluating the federal guidelines but authorities cannot put the \"cart before the horse.\"  <br><br>\"Please know that my administration is working doggedly to develop robust economic recovery plans alongside a plan for a thoughtful, staged and flexible reopening of our state -- and the moment we can safely implement those plans, they will be implemented with the same dedication and focus that we are using to contain this pandemic,\" the governor said. <br><br>New York <br><br>Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a \"New York State on PAUSE\" executive order which took effect on March 22. Schools and nonessential businesses are ordered to stay closed until May 15. <br><br>New York has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from Cuomo's office.  <br><br>The governor has not come to any decision on when businesses will reopen and said he rejected \"any elected official or any expert who says I can tell you what's going to happen four weeks from today.\" <br><br>The governor said April 16 there are factors for when a business can reopen, including how essential it is and what is the risk of catching the virus. <br><br>North Carolina  <br><br>Gov. Roy Cooper issued a stay-at-home order for the state effective until April 29. <br><br>The governor said that the more people adhere to social distancing requirements in April, the sooner the state will loosen restrictions. <br><br>\"We have a team examining how North Carolina can emerge with the right practices in place to keep us healthy and strong and ready to jump start our economy,\" Cooper said in Monday's press briefing. <br><br>\"We're considering the most effective ways to modify executive orders to help boost the economy while continuing to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.\" <br><br>North Dakota <br><br>Gov. Doug Burgum has only shut down schools, restaurants, fitness centers, movie theaters and salons. Burgum declared a state of emergency on March 13. <br><br>North Dakota is one of the states that has not issued a stay-at-home order. <br><br>Burgum has said he hopes some businesses can start to reopen May 1. <br><br>Ohio <br><br>Gov. Mike DeWine issued a statewide stay-at-home order that will remain in place until May 1. <br><br>He said April 16 that on that date the state will begin the first phase of reopening. <br><br>\"We are working on (specifics) and will be talking about this in the days ahead. We will be dealing with the schools shortly, probably early next week,\" he said. <br><br>As for events with big crowds, he said, \"We need to take this a few weeks at a time to see where we are.\" <br><br>Oklahoma <br><br>Gov. Kevin Stitt said April 15 that he is working on a plan to reopen the state's economy, possibly as early as April 30. <br><br>At the same time, Stitt extended Oklahoma's \"Safer at Home\" order for adults over the age of 65 and other vulnerable residents until May 6. Elective surgeries will be allowed to resume April 24. <br><br>Stitt has said the state would have to ease into reopening its economy. <br><br> \"We're doing this with the guidance of the experts, being data driven... based on what's happening in Oklahoma, not what's going on in a different state or different city,\" Stitt said. <br><br>Oregon <br><br>Gov. Kate Brown issued an executive order directing Oregonians to stay at home that \"remains in effect until ended by the governor.\" <br><br>Brown announced a joint Western States Pact with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on April 13. <br><br>\"This is not a light switch going on or off,\" Brown told CNN's Anderson Cooper on April 14. \"This is going to be making a change, testing it, modeling it, seeing whether it works, and then if it does, you can make another change.\" <br><br>Brown said she would not ease restrictions before seeing five components in place: declining growth rate of active cases, sufficient personal protective equipment, surge capacity in hospitals, increased test capacity, contact tracing and isolating positive cases, and strategies to protect vulnerable communities. <br><br>Pennsylvania <br><br>Gov. Tom Wolf issued stay-at-home orders across the state until April 30. <br><br>Pennsylvania has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.  <br><br>Wolf said April 17 there is \"no magic wand to wave to get us back to where we want to be.\"  <br><br>He said no one can flip a switch on the economy and the state shouldn't rush. <br><br>\"We can't be impulsive. We can't be emotional,\" he said. <br><br>Rhode Island <br><br>Gov. Gina Raimondo issued an emergency declaration extending the state's stay-at-home order to last until May 8. <br><br>Rhode Island has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a press release from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.  <br><br>To reopen the state, Raimondo said there would need to be advanced testing and contact tracing put in place.  <br><br>\"It is clear that what you're doing is working,\" Raimondo said, referring to residents staying at home. \"It's keeping you safer. It's keeping Rhode Islanders safer. And quite frankly it's making it so I can really start thinking about reopening this economy sooner rather than later.\" <br><br>South Carolina <br><br>Gov. Henry McMaster announced that at 5 p.m. on April 20, some retail stores will be allowed to open, including those selling furniture, books, music, flowers, clothing and accessories, as well as department stores, sporting goods stores and flea markets. They will be allowed to open at 20% capacity, or 5 people per 1,000 square feet. <br><br>Beaches will be reopened beginning Tuesday at noon, McMaster said at a press conference. <br><br>McMaster's \"State of Emergency\" executive order is in place through at least April 27. <br><br>South Dakota <br><br>Gov. Kristi L. Noem has not issued a stay-at-home order. <br><br>\"We have seen such  an outstanding  call to action among the people of South Dakota that we actually have more people staying home than many of the other states that have put in shelter in place orders and have put together directives to tell people they can't leave their homes,\" she said at a town hall hosted by South Dakota Public Broadcasting on April 15. <br><br>Tennessee <br><br>Gov. Bill Lee said April 20 that the state's order for residents to remain at home will expire April 30, \"with the vast majority of businesses in 89 counties allowed to re-open on May 1,\" according to a statement from the governor's office. <br><br>\"Our Economic Recovery Group is working with industry leaders around the clock so that some businesses can open as soon as Monday, April 27,\" Lee said. \"These businesses will open according to specific guidance that we will provide in accordance with state and national experts in both medicine and business. <br><br>The state will work with the \"major metropolitan areas to ensure they are in a position to reopen as soon and safely as possible,\" Lee added. \"Social distancing works, and as we open up our economy it will be more important than ever that we keep social distancing as lives and livelihoods depend on it.\" <br><br>Texas <br><br>Gov. Greg Abbott ordered all Texans to stay home through April 30.  <br><br>Instead of kicking off a full restart, the Texas governor announced April 17 that a group of medical and economic experts will guide him through a series of incremental steps aimed at slowly reopening the state's economy. <br><br>\"Opening in Texas must occur in stages,\" Abbott said during his briefing Friday. \"Obviously, not all businesses can open all at once on May 1.\" A premature opening of private businesses, he said, would risk further outbreaks and \"be more likely to set us back, rather than to propel us forward.\" <br><br>Utah <br><br>Gov. Gary Herbert extended the state's \"Stay Safe, Stay Home\" directive through May 1. Schools will be closed for the remainder of the year.  <br><br>Utah has not issued a stay-at-home mandate.  <br><br>People have been asked to stay home as much as possible and maintain 6 feet from others when out. Restaurants are not allowed to have dining rooms open. School are closed. <br><br>Herbert said the state is making plans for how and when restrictions will be lifted, but continued to urge citizens to stay home.  <br><br>Vermont <br><br>Gov. Phil Scott issued a \"Stay Home, Stay Safe\" order that has been extended until May 15. <br><br>Scott on April 17 outlined a five-point plan to reopen the state while continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus during a news conference. <br><br>Part of that plan includes certain businesses such as construction, home appraisers, property management and municipal clerks to return to work on April 20, with social distancing measures in place. These businesses will be allowed a maximum of two workers. <br><br>On May 1, farmers markets will be able to operate with strict social distancing guidelines in place, Scott said. <br><br>Virginia <br><br>Gov. Ralph Northam issued a stay-at-home order effective until June 10. <br><br>\"We are in a public health crisis, and we need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly,\" Northam said in a news release. \"Our message to Virginians is clear: stay home.\" <br><br>Northam has made it clear that the state must make decisions based on \"science, public health expertise, and data,\" Secretary of Health and Human Resources Daniel Carey said.  <br><br>Washington <br><br>Gov. Jay Inslee extended Washignton's stay-at-home order until May 4, saying \"We are yet to see the full toll of this virus in our state and the modeling we've seen could be much worse if we don't continue what we're doing to slow the spread.\" <br><br>Inslee announced a joint Western States Pact with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on April 13.  <br><br>Before deciding on when to reopen the state, Inslee said during an interview with Katy Tur on MSNBC that there would need to be an \"enormous expansions\" of coronavirus testing capabilities, a way to trace the spread in communities, and \"for the president to recognize that these decisions really are going to be made by governors.\" <br><br>West Virginia <br><br>Gov. Jim Justice issued a stay-at-home order until further notice.  <br><br>\"That curve is the curve we're looking for to be able to look at the possibility of backing things off and going forward. We're not there yet,\" Justice said during a news conference April 13.  <br><br>Despite numbers suggesting that the state is starting to do better, Justice said it wasn't time to relax social distancing measures or asking people to stop staying home.  <br><br>\"I'm proud of each and every one of you so keep following the guidelines, stay at home, social distance, practice good hygiene and when the time comes, and it will, we'll cross the finish line together as West Virginians,\" Justice said in a news release. <br><br>Wisconsin <br><br>Gov. Tony Evers has extended his state's stay-at-home order to expire May 26, according to a statement from the governor's office.  <br><br>The extension also loosens some restrictions on businesses. Golf courses are allowed to reopen, and public libraries and arts and crafts stores may offer curbside pickup, the April 16 announcement said. <br><br>Wyoming <br><br>Gov. Mark Gordon submitted a request asking for a federal disaster declaration for Wyoming on April 9. Wyoming is one of the states without a stay-at-home order.  <br><br>\"Though Wyoming has not reached the dire situations of some states, this declaration will help us to prepare and mobilize resources when we need them,\" Governor Gordon said in a news release. \"I look forward to a swift response to our request from the federal government.\" <br><br>Gordon extended statewide public health orders through April 30 and issued a directive requiring travelers to quarantine for 14 days.  <br><br>Correction: This story has been updated to correct details about what businesses in Nebraska will be closed and the duration of those closings. <br><br>CNN's Janine Mack, Dylan Wells, Angie Trindade, Cat Gloria, Ganesh Setty, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Chris Boyette, Christina Maxouris, Artemis Moshtaghian and Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "117", "title": "Aides hope to give Trump his economic 'big bang' starting in May"}, {"id": "50", "title": "Divisions on battling coronavirus deepen as Trump and Southern states push opening"}, {"id": "223", "title": "With lobbying push, gyms get on Phase One of Trump's reopening plan"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

That time, the world came together", "content": "In 1911, a deadly epidemic spread through China and threatened to become a pandemic. Its origins appeared to be related to the trade in wild animals, but at the time no one was sure.  <br><br>Lockdowns, quarantine measures, the wearing of masks, travel restrictions, the mass cremation of victims, and border controls were deployed to try to lower the infection rate. Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern-day northeast China, making it one of the world's largest epidemics at the time.  <br><br>When the disease was eventually brought under control, the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak.  <br><br>In attendance were virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world's major powers -- the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and France.  <br><br>The purpose of the conference was to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave. While the conference was not without some finger pointing, it was mostly a genuine attempt to learn. <br><br>As the world now faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co-ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders, the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in north-eastern China are worth reconsidering.    <br><br>Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) appears compromised, the virus has been racialized, major nations are angry with each other and competing for resources and control of the narrative, while poorer countries are left to fend largely for themselves.  <br><br>Compared to 1911, we appear a polarized and divided world.   <br><br>Marmots and plague <br><br>The Great Manchurian Plague that broke out across northeastern China in 1910 was devastating.  <br><br>From the autumn of 1910, until the outbreak was finally suppressed the following year, an estimated 63,000 people died. The epidemic hit international headlines when it reached the northeastern city of Harbin, in today's Heilongjiang province. Harbin was then part of what was known as Manchuria, a vast, agriculturally important but sparsely populated region situated on the juncture of the Chinese, Japanese and Russian spheres of influence. The majority of the territory was Chinese-governed, with Japan controlling the port area around Dalian and Russia running Manchuria's railways.  <br><br>Harbin was an international city, home to many Russians who worked for the China Eastern Railway (CER), which connected the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Japanese-controled port city of Dalian. The city was also home to large communities of Japanese, Americans and Europeans engaged in trades connected to the railway.  <br><br>That included the fur trade, and it was from this industry that the disease most likely came.   <br><br>The Tarbagan marmot was a species of rodent that lived mostly on the grasslands and steppe of Mongolia and neighboring Manchuria. European, American and Japanese furriers had long purchased sable, mink and otter furs from local hunters, but had never been interested in the coarse fur of the Tarbagan marmot. But new dying techniques at the start of the century allowed marmot fur to pass as an affordable alternative for better-quality furs. <br><br>Thousands of nomadic local hunters were tasked by foreign buyers with bringing marmot hides, which soared in value in the years before the virus. Rural hunters had long avoided using diseased marmots for food, but did not think to cast aside the hides of sick animals -- especially not when they were worth so much.   <br><br>Pinpointing the initial outbreak of the plague is hard, but it was first officially noted by Russian doctors in Manzhouli, an Inner Mongolian town on the Chinese-Russian border, which had grown up around the CER. The symptoms were alarming -- fever followed by haemoptysis (the coughing up of blood). In Manzhouli, the dead were left in the street and railway freight cars were turned into quarantine wards. <br><br>Just as viruses spread fast along airline routes today, back then the railways facilitated the spread. Fear in Manzhouli meant many people followed the routes the marmot hides had taken along the CER to the Heilongjiang city of Qiqihar, and then on to Harbin.  <br><br>Cases of the pneumonic plague appeared in major rail termini -- Tianjin, Beijing and along the Beijing to Wuhan railway. Even Shanghai, almost 2,000 miles from Manzhouli, reported a case and considered a lockdown of the city to prevent wider infection. In the crowded slums of Harbin, the disease took hold swiftly. By November 8, 1910, Harbin had a death toll of 5,272. <br><br>Initial response and debates <br><br>The response to the outbreak was rapid, given the logistical constraints at the start of the 20th century.  <br><br>Quarantine centers were established, mostly in converted rail freight cars, for people the authorities thought had have come into contact with the disease -- relatives of the dead plus those in the fur trapping and trading business. <br><br>If the quarantined didn't show symptoms within five-to-10 days they were released with a wire wristband fastened with a lead seal stating they were plague free. But if symptoms did show, the entire freight car was essentially doomed, given the disease's staggering near 100% mortality rate. Burials were forbidden; mass cremations were enforced.   <br><br>In Harbin, the Chinese authorities' lead doctor Wu Lien-teh, a Malaysia-born ethnic-Chinese medic educated at Cambridge University, was managing to contain the outbreak.  <br><br>Wu began post-mortem exams of victims and crucially established that the disease was pneumonic plague and not bubonic (the difference between the forms of plague is the location of infection; in pneumonic plague the infection is in the lungs, in bubonic plague, the lymph nodes). He also heavily recommended the wearing of face masks. <br><br>By early 1911, China had mobilized doctors and epidemiologists from across China to converge on Harbin. Wu knew there was a big deadline looming. Chinese New Year was officially January 30 and Wu knew that limiting travel would be almost impossible during the annual migration home for so many Chinese people.  <br><br>If the infection rate wasn't brought down, then it risked becoming a nationwide epidemic.  <br><br>The response was sometimes harsh -- any lodging house where an infection appeared was burnt to the ground. But overall Wu's anti-plague measures worked. So-called \"sanitary zones,\" quarantines, lockdowns, isolation, travel restrictions and face masks were all implemented and appear to have brought the infection rate in Harbin down by the end of January.  <br><br>Infections had spread, however, along the rail line. By the start of January 1911, Shenyang had over 2,571 deaths. Eventually, quarantining and travel restrictions in Shenyang began to take effect and the infection rate fell. But the rail line extended onwards and several towns close to the major port city of Dalian reported cases. <br><br>In Dalian itself, mass inspections of train and ship passengers were instituted, the line was then shut, and ferries from Dalian ordered to remain in port. This meant the plague never reached Dalian.   <br><br>Though cases continued to pop up across Manchuria and occasionally beyond, in Harbin, Wu declared the plague suppressed at the end of January 1911, with a final mass cremation of victims.  <br><br>It was time to convene an international conference to try to find out why the outbreak had been so severe and widespread -- and which anti-plague measures had worked best. <br><br>A conference in Shenyang <br><br>Yale professor William C Summers notes in his 2012 study of the Great Manchurian Plague that: \"By the end of January 1911, the momentum for some sort of international consortium of 'experts' to come together in China was building rapidly.\"   <br><br>The conference was not without risk for the Chinese. <br><br>China had a Russian-controlled rail line running through a vast swathe of its territory, Japan was ensconced in Dalian and controlling China's major northern seaport, and the European powers and US had treaty ports up and down the country.  <br><br>Still, they pushed ahead with hosting, which helped China avoid the charge of doing nothing in the aftermath of the epidemic. All attendees pledged that the conference was primarily concerned with scientific investigation, and not with imposing any further controls on China from outside.  <br><br>By April 3, 1911, Shenyang's Shao Ho Yien palace had been turned into a conference center that included meeting rooms, laboratories for experiments and living quarters for the delegates. As well as the principal countries mentioned, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria-Hungary all sent experts. Many were from prestigious institutes.   <br><br>The main body of the conference sought to deal with eliminating the bad science and gossip, and getting to the scientific root of the bacteria. It was high-level science for the day -- bacterial toxins, surface agglutinins, variant strains. There was also discussion of modes of contagion such as coughing and false theories such as the passing of the bacillus on food. There even was talk of what we would now call asymptomatic patients and super-spreaders.   <br><br>Containment was a major theme. What had worked best? Emergency quarantine and travel measures, certainly. Also, the early use of face masks which predated Wu's discovery of the bacillus as pneumonic. Additionally, the rapid construction of plague hospitals to isolate the infected and potentially infected from ordinary hospital patients.  <br><br>The conference wrapped on April 28, 1911, with closing remarks by Wu. Ultimately, China's fears that Russia, Japan or the European powers would use the conference to advance their political aims against China didn't materialize. <br><br>The conference's conclusions and resolutions dealt with the science of the plague, the need for sanitary improvements, quarantine regulations and the unwitting cause of the epidemic, the Tarbagan marmot.  <br><br>Closing the conference Dr Wu urged that: \"Every effort should be made to secure effective medical education in China.\"  <br><br>Global responses <br><br>In 1911 there was no WHO.   <br><br>The response to the epidemic, the job of trying to limit its spread and suppress it, was left to individual nations, often nations with political antagonisms.   <br><br>There were no politicians in Shenyang, only scientists who saw the need for a global intergovernmental response -- and a global health organization. That did begin to emerge after the First World War with the League of Nations formed in the wake of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The League took on matters relating to health through its Health Bureau, formed by an executive section of medical experts.  <br><br>The bureau targeted the eradication of leprosy, malaria and yellow fever and successfully helped to contain epidemics of typhus in Russia and various outbreaks of cholera and typhoid in China between the wars. After World War II, the League's successor, the United Nations, created the WHO.  <br><br>The Great Manchurian Plague did not ultimately spread in any serious way to the rest of China, Mongolia or Russia. The shutdown of Dalian port stopped the spread out from Manchuria to major destinations in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. <br><br>From there it could have moved by ocean liner to Europe, America and throughout the world. But it didn't.  <br><br>Summers, the historian, said that containment was down to a joined up response. <br><br>\"Such a conjunction of the right knowledge, the right resources, and the right people has not always been the case in other global challenges of epidemic disease,\" he said.  <br><br>Measures taken today around the world -- specially constructed quarantine hospitals, mask wearing ordinances, enhanced sanitary practices, travel restrictions, grounded planes and dedicated teams of healthcare workers -- in many ways replicate those taken 110 years ago in northeastern China.   <br><br>However, the major players today -- the US, China, the nations of the European Union, and Japan -- seemingly have little interest in a coordinated response to the health crisis and prospects of any apolitical conference seem remote. <br><br>In 1911, the world's leading disease experts were eager to get to China. <br><br>Perhaps that is what needs to happen at some point after the coronavirus pandemic: the world's scientists could circumvent the politicians to find a way to meet, share and discuss Covid-19 in an open forum.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "108", "title": "How the government delayed coronavirus testing"}, {"id": "135", "title": "How did coronavirus break out?

The same process can take days or even weeks for traditional manufacturers, he added.  <br><br>The list of products that can be 3D printed is a testament to the technology's potential to ease the medical supply crisis. HP alone has printed and distributed more than 50,000 products from its centers in the US and Spain over the last two months, including face shields, protective masks and door handles you can open with your elbow to avoid touching them with your hands. It's also working on developing nasal swabs that can be used to test for the virus and an emergency field ventilator made with 3D-printed parts that it aims to start producing in the coming weeks following additional tests. <br><br>Despite this groundswell of activity, there are limitations on how far 3D printing can go to genuinely bridge the gap. While some hospitals have turned to this technology to shore up their supplies, safety concerns remain for 3D printing certain critical medical equipment, including ventilators. Hospital leaders may not be comfortable with using these products. The US Food and Drug Administration has sounded a note of caution on the effort, and government authorities have only approved a fraction of the 3D-printed device applications they have received so far. <br><br>\"While the FDA understands that 3D printing may occur to provide wider availability of devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency,\" the agency notes on its website, \"some devices are more amenable to 3D printing than others.\" <br><br>'A war effort' <br><br>Inside the 3D printing community -- as well as parts of the medical community -- hopes appear to be high. University and school libraries are bringing their machines together, individual enthusiasts are pitching in from home, and smaller companies are joining forces with rivals to speed up the production of medical equipment.  <br><br>Tangible Creative, which has 100 3D printers at its warehouse in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Brooklyn-based competitor MakerBot and Columbia University to create a coalition called the Covid Makers Response. The group is currently printing roughly 2,000 face shields a day, which volunteers pick up and drop off at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. They are then assembled and sent to more than 30 hospitals in the area.  <br><br>\"It was like a war effort,\" said Tangible's co-founder and CEO Nevaris A.C.  <br><br>It's part of a larger movement among big and small businesses to reorient their manufacturing operations toward producing medical supplies. Major US automakers are now making ventilators, tech firms such as Apple (AAPL) are designing face shields and companies that make phone accessories and gaming hardware are switching to mask production. While most of those companies are repurposing their existing manufacturing bases for the equipment, Ford said it will use 3D printing to make some disposable masks at its Advanced Manufacturing Center. <br><br>\"One of the really incredible things that's happened over the entire time scale of the crisis is this incredible community,\" said Anthony Costa of New York's Mount Sinai hospital network. Costa is a professor at the hospital's medical school and the director of Sinai Biodesign, a center that works on medical innovations that has been helping source 3D-printed equipment for the network's hospitals. <br><br>\"They have done it at sort of a crowd-sourced level,\" he added. \"Everyone who has a 3D printer in their basement, all the way to the prototyping facilities that we work with throughout the city, have all retooled all of their resources to make sure that we get to components that can have an impact.\"  <br><br>President Trump earlier this month invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of ventilators and other equipment, but the bulk of deliveries aren't expected to arrive until June.  <br><br>3D printing companies say they can't substitute traditional manufacturing, but their relative speed and ability to scale could make them an effective stopgap solution as medical workers continue to operate in crisis mode.  <br><br>\"It allows you to move very quickly and so it allows you to fill those short-term supply chain gaps ... and obviously that's what this is,\" said Greg Kessler, CEO of 3D printing company Shapeways. \"That's why 3D printing is a very good solution during these times.\" <br><br>Shapeways has also been supplying face shields to New York hospitals and is working on producing nasal swabs and ventilator splitters that allow one ventilator to be used by multiple patients.  <br><br>Not all 3D-printed medical equipment is the same <br><br>Some medical equipment is easier to produce than others. That's why so much of the 3D-printing effort has been focused on items like face shields.  <br><br>\"Typically, as long as face shields fit comfortably and snugly across the forehead, are long enough to cover one's facemask but not so long that they bump against the provider's upper chest when looking down, and the plastic shield is clear and easy to see through, then the shield is good to go,\" Jeanne Noble, a professor of emergency medicine and director of coronavirus response at the University of California, San Francisco medical center, told CNN Business.  <br><br>The specific requirements of more fundamental medical equipment such as ventilators and masks make them tougher to design and often require approval from the FDA to produce. Ventilators in particular are becoming increasingly critical, as several states face massive shortages and have warned they may struggle to save patients when the pandemic peaks.  <br><br>\"As you move up the risk scale, senior leadership starts to get involved to better understand, what risk are we really putting patients at?\" said Costa, of Mount Sinai. \"And certainly for something like a ventilator, you know, a life-sustaining device, we're not just going to get a part from a store and implement it, we're not simply going to 3D print something and not study it.\" <br><br>The FDA has released guidance cautioning that 3D-printed equipment provides a physical barrier but may not be able to keep out smaller liquid or airborne particles as effectively.  <br><br>\"3D-printed masks may look like conventional PPE,\" according to the FDA website. \"However, they may not provide the same level of barrier protection, fluid resistance, filtration, and infection control.\" <br><br>A spokesperson for the FDA said the agency has formed a partnership with the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs to assess 3D printed designs. So far only one face mask and eight face shields have been approved through the partnership for clinical use. Another four mask designs have been approved only for community use.  <br><br>\"We are willing to be flexible and adapt to this pandemic, so that we can get essential medical devices to those in need,\" the spokesperson said. \"As long as data supports the application, we are authorizing these products quickly.\" <br><br>A massive network, ready to go <br><br>Right now, some hospitals are continuing to move forward with select 3D-printed supplies. UCSF, for example, is working with 3D printing firm Carbon to create nasal swabs for coronavirus testing that Noble estimates will be available in the next two weeks.  <br><br>\"This is a critical contribution given the scarcity of testing swabs that we are still facing,\" she said.  <br><br>And there's a huge potential network of 3D printers across the country that could be tapped into. Nearly 600,000 consumer 3D printers priced at less than $5000 were sold in the US in 2018, according to report last year by the Federation of American Scientists.  <br><br>Tangible Creative, HP and Shapeways have all made their design files available online for anyone that is able and willing to print them.  <br><br>\"It's not like you need a mold,\" said Eugene Chang, Tangible's co-founder and industrial design director. \"You have this digital file and you can just send it to people, and they can hit print, just like how you send an email and can print it out on a 2D printer.\"  <br><br>But Costa said more advanced equipment, even with the necessary approvals, would require industrial grade printers. As of 2018, according to the FAS report, 140,000 of those were sold worldwide.  <br><br>Once the regulatory and testing hurdles are cleared, however, 3D printing firms say they can move very quickly into mass production. Pastor said HP has the capacity to print 1 million swabs a week in the US alone.  <br><br>\"Even building a new 3D printing factory is actually a question of weeks,\" he said. \"You can react within weeks and actually double, triple, quadruple your capacity if you want to.\"  <br><br>Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the FDA's role in vetting 3D printed device applications. The Department of Veterans Affairs assesses 3D printed designs. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "120", "title": "The world is coming together to fight coronavirus.

Now he's taking on America's ventilator shortage", "content": ", Texas (CNN Business)Victor Radulescu thought he would never see another ventilator.  <br><br>Early on in his career, the young engineer spent a year helping to design the breathing assistance machines at Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer. But then, about four years ago, he made a switch and joined rocket startup Virgin Orbit. He's since spent the past few years helping to design a 70-foot rocket that could launch from beneath the wing of a 747 airplane and deliver small satellites into outer space. <br><br>\"I was completely enamored,\" Radulescu, 29, said of his newfound work in avionics.  <br><br>Then, the coronavirus pandemic struck. And by mid-March, Covid-19 was spreading rapidly across the United States. <br><br>Virgin Orbit was granted \"essential business\" status, the company said, because of its partnerships with NASA and the Defense Department. But first, its factory in Long Beach, California, would shut down for a week for a deep cleaning. <br><br>Employees headed home, and the mission of firing satellites into space seemed to lose some of its urgency. A few engineers, including Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart, wondered how the company might help address looming medical supply shortages that threatened to overwhelm the health care community. <br><br>That's when Radulescu received the call to help. Virgin Orbit propulsion engineer Kevin Zagorski remembered that Radulescu used to work for Medtronic (MDT), one of only a handful of companies in the world that makes hospital-grade ventilators. <br><br>Could Virgin Orbit make ventilators, too? Zagorski asked him. <br><br>\"In these conversations, my mind \u2014 it's like a switch flipped,\" Radulescu said. \"I was all ventilators again.\" <br><br>By the next day, Radulescu and Zagorski were on a call with a group of US doctors that had organized under the name Bridge Ventilator Consortium. The two engineers heard the doctors chatting excitedly about designs for simple breathing machines that could, in theory, be quickly manufactured on a large scale. <br><br>Within 15 hours, Virgin Orbit had put an ad hoc team together and built a prototype, Radulescu said. <br><br>What the Virgin Orbit team came up with is a far less sophisticated machine than the ventilators Radulescu used to help design at Medtronic. But, if doctors run out of options, these so-called \"bridge ventilators\" could help thousands of Covid-19 patients who begin to lose the ability to breathe on their own, freeing up more sophisticated ventilators for the most critical cases. <br><br>Under pressure <br><br>Manufacturers around the world \u2014 including Ford, General Motors, Dyson and Xerox \u2014 have been adopting wartime-like efforts to scale up ventilator production. Some are helping medical device makers build more of their devices. Others, like Virgin Orbit, are trying to quickly put together new designs.  <br><br>But it's a race against time. US hospitals could need as many as half a million additional ventilators during the pandemic, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. <br><br>Radulescu knew from his one-year stint at Medtronic that quickly building thousands of traditional ventilators \u2014 the kind typically used by intensive care doctors \u2014 wasn't feasible. <br><br>\"I had an appreciation for how complex and sophisticated these devices are,\" Radulescu said. \"We were immediately aware that we would not be able to recreate or replace them.\" <br><br>So, Virgin Orbit decided to design its own. <br><br>Radulescu notes that there is some overlap in the engineering of ventilators and rockets. The same math and physics apply to pressure \u2014 whether it's the pressure of a rocket fuel combustion chamber or the pressure ventilators use to push oxygen into a patient's lungs. But the scale is radically different: Rocket engineers think about pressure in terms of pounds per square inch, a unit 70 times larger than the one used in the medica equipment world.  <br><br>Radulescu also understood that making life-supporting medical equipment required exhaustive testing. But things are no different in rocketry.  <br><br>\"In some ways, the level of testing and verification we have to meet for aerospace are much more stringent than what I had seen in [the medical device field],\" Radulescu added. After all, \"our electronics have to work in the vacuum of space, being bombarded by solar and cosmic radiation at extreme temperature ranges.\" <br><br>A call to action <br><br>As the coronavirus outbreak spread into the United States, Dr. Brian Wong, a plastic surgeon at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center, wanted to know what doctors on the front lines could do if they ran out of ventilators. In March, Wong organized daily conference calls on Zoom to brainstorm ideas with a couple of his colleagues, and they adopted the name Bridge Ventilator Consortium. Soon, medical professionals from all over the country began dialing in. <br><br>Many of their discussions centered on Ambu bags, which are cheap, barrel-shaped devices commonly stocked in emergency rooms and ambulances. They're used to resuscitate people who stop breathing. The problem is that physicians have to manually operate the device by squeezing down on the bag, making them an impractical solution for COVID-19 patients who may need breathing assistance for weeks at a time. <br><br>The BVC doctors had heard about a group of engineers in Spain with a plan to automate that process: Using a windshield wiper motor, they rigged a machine that could act like a human thumb, pressing down on the Ambu bag over and over.  <br><br>Dr. Wong hoped a few US manufacturers could build a similar device. But he didn't expect a 20-something rocket scientist from Long Beach to be among the first to answer that call. <br><br>\"Patients are not motors; they're not rockets; they're not satellites,\" Wong said. \"But when you have an incredible engineering team like that, they get up to speed very quickly.\" <br><br>After their first call with the BVC doctors, Radulescu and Zagorski used a white board at Virgin Orbit's rocket factory and engineering software they typically used for rockets, to crunch numbers and sketch out a design.  <br><br>The next morning, they purchased a windshield wiper motor from Autozone and met up with two more of their colleagues for a marathon engineering session. They designed the machine to use as few components as possible and relied on parts that Virgin Orbit could easily find in large numbers.  <br><br>But Radulescu said he also knew it wouldn't be safe to create a device that only did the bare minimum. <br><br>\"If the goal is to allow the clinician to set this machine up and walk away, we should add different alarms and warnings,\" Radulescu said. \"One thing I'd seen on other ventilators is, if the power disconnects, the [device] will actually [make] an extremely loud and audible signal that says, 'Hey, you've lost power here!'\" <br><br>The team assembled its first prototype within a day, and less than a week later they built a second and third version and sent the design to US regulators for approval, Radulescu said. <br><br>\"I was amazed.\" Dr. Govind Rajan, an anesthesiologist at UCI, said. \"They took all these ideas, synthesized them and they put it together very fast \u2014 which is what is critical right now.\" <br><br>From prototype to production <br><br>Some Virgin Orbit employees are still focused on rockets. A skeleton staff continues to work toward the company's first orbital launch attempt in the coming weeks. But the startup estimates it can also churn out 100 bridge ventilators within a week, double that rate a week later, and continue scaling up from there. Virgin Orbit says the devices could be manufactured on assembly lines set up right alongside the rocket bodies and engines that litter its 180,000 square-foot factory. <br><br>The company said the vast majority of its employees are working from home, and those who must be on site at the factory will maintain proper social distancing whenever possible. <br><br>Radulescu, who said the ventilator team has been careful to keep their distance while in the same room together, said they are still working out how to avoid potential kinks in its supply chain, particularly when it comes to the Ambu bags. <br><br>\"We want to make sure we're not in a position where we're competing with hospitals,\" he said. His team is planning to deliver its first batch of ventilators fully assembled, and then allowing hospitals to buy the Ambu bags themselves. The machine is designed to allow doctors to install the bags into the bridge ventilator machine when needed. <br><br>But before mass production can start, Virgin Orbit needs the green light from the Food and Drug Administration. <br><br>The agency said last month that it wanted to do everything possible to expedite approvals for such devices, and Will Pomerantz, Virgin Orbit's vice president of special projects, said regulators are helping the startup navigate the application process. <br><br>That work is ongoing, and Pomerantz isn't sure when final word may come. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. <br><br>The agency has to walk a fine line \u2014 balancing the urgent need to get lifesaving devices in the hands of doctors, and ensuring stopgap solutions are still safe. <br><br>Meanwhile, doctors all over the world fear shortages would force them to choose which patients to save.  <br><br>\"There is no ideal solution,\" Wong said. He added that bridge ventilators are among dozens of proposed alternatives to traditional ventilators \u2014 and nobody yet knows how effective any given approach will be. <br><br>There are promising signs in Spain, where Ambu bag ventilators were successfully tested on pigs, received approval for clinical trials and are now being used on Covid-19 patients at several Spanish hospitals, according to Protofy, the engineering firm behind the bridge ventilator design. <br><br>It's not yet clear if any of those patients have since recovered from the virus. <br><br>For all their efforts, the Virgin Orbit engineers say they hope doctors will never be forced to use their machines. But they're still working tirelessly, Radulescu said, adding that looming medical supply shortages felt like \"a call to action.\" <br><br>\"I think in the back of our minds,\" he said, \"we're all aware that, the more we delay and the longer we take, it could cost lives.\" <br><br>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Victor Radulescu's last name.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

There's no reason to fret about dogs and coronavirus, experts say. <br><br>\"I do not believe that any dog owners should be concerned as a result of this work,\" said professor James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge in the UK.  <br><br>\"I do not see anything in this paper to support this supposition and am concerned that this paper has been published in this journal,\" said Wood, who researches infection dynamics and disease control.   <br><br>\"There is far too much inference and far too little direct data,\" Wood concluded. <br><br>\"Do we have to worry about getting it from our dogs or do we have to worry about giving it to our dogs?\" asked infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. <br><br>\"The answer to both of those questions is no.\" <br><br>The search for compatible hosts <br><br>Around the world scientists are feverishly burning the midnight oil at their home computers or makeshift labs, looking for the holy grail of virology: the animal responsible for transmitting the novel coronavirus known as Covid-SARS2 to humans. <br><br>Most agree bats are the original source  -- bats have been the host for several deadly viruses that have jumped to man -- but the transmission wasn't direct. Bats had to have given the virus to another animal, which then gave it to people. <br><br>The first suspect was snakes purchased at a Wuhan \"wet market,\" a shopping area where people buy live wild animals to eat. It's thought to be the epicenter of the first case of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. <br><br>Researchers have since added wild civit cats, domestic cats, ferrets and pangolins (a scaly anteater) to the list of potential suspects, and now -- the intestines of stray dogs. <br><br>No one theory has the scientific world convinced, with comments flying back and forth in agreement and disagreement. <br><br>Only a computer analysis <br><br>The paper, published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, focused on a part of the coronavirus genome called CpG, and a protein in animal immune systems, Zap, which helps protect us from viruses.  <br><br>The study explored the idea that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to evade the protective human ZAP protein, also known as zinc finger antiviral protein, by reducing genomic CpG. Low levels of CpG would encourage the virus to replicate, the study speculated. <br><br>Of the thousands of genomes analyzed, dog intestines were the best host for replication, said study author Xuhua Xia, a biology professor at the University of Ottawa. <br><br>\"Canis [dog genius] have a tissue that favors the evolution of coronaviruses with a low-CpG genome.\"  <br><br>He points out, however, that since not all mammals have been geneotyped and were available for analysis, there could be additional candidates.  <br><br>\"The respiratory tract and the digestive tract -- they share the mouth as the common opening,\" said Xia, therefore, it makes sense that a respiratory virus could be swallowed and cause digestive symptoms.  <br><br>In fact, a recent study out of China found one third of the early Wuhan patients with Covid-19 had diarrhea.  <br><br>However, there is no real world evidence of SARS-CoV2 transmission in dogs. On the contrary, another recent study on real dogs -- not computers -- found the virus replicates very poorly in canines, thus indicating that they are a likely dead end for transmission. <br><br>Xia argues that CpG levels in the digestive tract of feral dogs would be a more favorable replication site than the lungs, so therefore the previous study showing dogs were not efficient transmitters via the respiratory tract may not apply.  <br><br>Critics are skeptical. <br><br>\"The theory that SARS-CoV2 originated in dogs seems to stem from speculation about CpG and high Zap expression. This is speculative at best and certainly isn't strong evidence for the link,\" said Mick Watson, personal chair of bioinformatics and computational biology at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh. <br><br>\"This study is based on re-analysis of old data without any new data,\" said Ben Neuman, chair of biological sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, adding that the research has similarities to an earlier paper that incorrectly named snakes as the origin of SARS-CoV-2. <br><br>\"It is going to take some new data to finally solve the mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2,\" Neuman said. \"The conclusion that cats or dogs were involved as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is highly speculative, and should not be presented as fact.\" <br><br>Animals as food sources <br><br>If the hypothesis was true, how would the virus jump from feral dogs to people? Xia suggests it could be transmitted to a person if they touched the dog's feces or was licked or bit by a dog who had recently cleaned its rectal area. <br><br>Or perhaps it could occur by selling animals to eat at the \"wet market\" in Wuhan, as was suggested with the snake hypothesis. <br><br>\"It has got nothing to do with eating the animal,\" said Vanderbilt's Schaffner. <br><br>\"We don't think food is a mode of transmission of this virus,\" Schaffner said. \"There are two ways it can transmit -- the animal is butchered and you create aerosols during the course of butchering and breathe them in.  <br><br>\"Or you can get your hands contaminated and then touch the mucus membranes of your own mouth and nose.\" <br><br>Putting into perspective <br><br>To verify his computer hypothesis, Xia would need to find a grant or other resources to test stray dogs in the wild.  <br><br>\"This suggests the importance of monitoring SARS-like coronaviruses in feral dogs in the fight against SARS-CoV-2,\" Xia said. <br><br>While that's a reasonable hypothesis based on the study of viruses, it will take time to do, and the results may or may not support the theory, just as other hypotheses have fallen to the wayside. <br><br>\"I am confident that answers about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still out there, somewhere in the natural world, but we have not found them yet,\" Neuman said. <br><br>To put the study's conclusions into perspective for pet owners worldwide, Schaffner points to what he calls the key line in the paper: \"zoonotic transmission must be a very rare event.\" <br><br>\"There is near a 100% likelihood that there was just one transmission,\" Schaffner said. \"This is a powerful statement -- one transmission from some animal source to a human that likely occurred in a wet market in China.  <br><br>\"It happened only once, and all the other infections in humans that have occurred have come from that one instance of transmission.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "135", "title": "How did coronavirus break out?

The question has produced intense partisan conflict in some states, such as Kansas and Kentucky, where local Republicans and some church leaders have fought restrictions on in-service worshipping from Democratic governors.  <br><br>These skirmishes mark a new front in a widening debate over the meaning of religious liberty in an era when white Christians, for the first time in American history, have fallen below a majority of the population -- and face no prospect of reversing that decline in a nation that is growing more diverse and more secular.  <br><br>Compounding the volatility, these religious distinctions increasingly parallel the partisan divide. Studies show that white Christians still constitute a clear majority of self-identified Republicans; meanwhile, minorities, secular whites and Americans professing non-Christian faiths represent as many as three-fourths of Democrats.  <br><br>The state-level response to the coronavirus outbreak shows the influence of those contrasting profiles. While both Democratic and Republican governors have carved out exemptions for religious institutions, GOP leaders have generally put more weight on asserting claims of religious freedom.  <br><br>In Kansas, the GOP Legislature voted last week to overturn Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's decision to include churches in her ban on large gatherings -- only to have the state Supreme Court uphold her jurisdiction in a ruling just hours before Easter Sunday. In Kentucky, Republican US Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with the state's GOP attorney general, Daniel Cameron, denounced Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's decision to send state troopers to record the license plates of anyone attending an in-person church service on Sunday -- and to request that those parishioners self-quarantine for 14 days. In Wisconsin, GOP legislative leaders pressed Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to allow in-person church services; he refused, but did agree to allow drive-in services in which worshippers never leave their cars. <br><br>Forecast: More polarization <br><br>Such clashes are just the latest measure of the divisions likely to multiply between a Republican coalition still centered on white Christians and a Democratic Party revolving around the disparate groups who don't fit under that shrinking canopy. \"Long term it forecasts ... continued polarization between the parties and it'll make all kind of public policy issues very difficult to deal with,\" says University of Akron political scientist John C. Green, an expert in religion and politics. <br><br>The pandemic sharpens these disputes because it so starkly raises the stakes for both sides: Not only has the crisis compelled governments to assert almost unprecedented authority to limit religious gatherings, but it also has magnified the potential impact of religious institutions' actions on the health of the broader community. <br><br>The restrictions on gathering have unnerved some advocacy groups, who see them as potential harbingers of further constraints on religious freedom as American society grows more secular.  <br><br>\"I think this is really historic, what's going on,\" said Kelly Shackelford, president and CEO of the First Liberty Institute, a Texas-based group that promotes religious freedom from government intervention. \"At the beginning everybody was kind of playing well together ... but what's started to happen now is you've got people ... starting to do crazy stuff and discriminate against the church and attack religious entities.\"  <br><br>The question at this point, he says, is \"whether we are going to have a loss of First Amendment rights and religious freedoms in a permanent way. What is the new normal after all of this, legally?\" <br><br>Conversely, Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, says that exemptions for religious services in state gathering bans amount to unconstitutional discrimination in favor of religion.  <br><br>\"We should all be able to live confident in the promise of our Constitution that the government will not advantage or disadvantage any of us based on our religious beliefs, but with these religious exemptions that's exactly what the government is doing,\" she said. \"They are saying some of us get special treatment because of our religious beliefs even when that special treatment puts lives at risk. It is immoral ... but it's also unconstitutional.\" <br><br>Religion as dividing line <br><br>These contrasting perspectives, like so many other divisions in American society, now align almost perfectly with the country's partisan divide. <br><br>As in many other measures of American life in the 21st century, the US religious landscape is inexorably growing more diverse. But this systemic change has affected the parties in very different ways. The result is that religious affiliation has joined such key markers as race, age and geography as a principal dividing line between the two electoral coalitions. <br><br>Whites who identified as Christian represented a majority of America's population for most of the nation's history; as recently as 1991, they accounted for about three-fourths of adults, according to the National Opinion Research Center's annual General Social Survey. But as the nation has grown more racially and religiously diverse, and also more secular, that number fell below 50% for the first time around 2010, according to the research center's data. More recent studies, from the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute, two nonpartisan institutions, have found white Christians now account for only about two-fifths of the population. Adults unaffiliated with any religion have grown to represent one-fourth of the total, in both groups' studies, about the same share as racial minorities who identify as Christian.  <br><br>But while white Christians have fallen below majority status nationwide, they still represent 64% of all self-identified Republicans, according to data Pew provided me last year from some 170,000 survey interviews conducted in 2018 and 2019. Nonwhite Christians represent another 14% of the party, Pew found, while those unaffiliated with any religion (15%) or belonging to non-Christian faiths (4%) composed most of the remainder. (The Public Religion Research Institute results were very similar.) <br><br>The Democratic profile is strikingly different. White Christians now make up only 25% of the party, Pew found, while racial minorities who identify as Christian account for another 30%. About 1 in 11 Democrats observed non-Christian faiths. Fully one-third of Democrats don't identify with any religion at all -- a larger cohort than either group of Christians. (The Public Religion Research Institute study paints a slightly different picture among Democrats, placing white Christians at about a third of the party and the religiously unaffiliated around one-fourth.) <br><br>By either the Pew or PRRI measures, the gap between each party's reliance on white Christians is as wide as at any point within memory. Most experts agree the Democratic coalition now revolves around two divergent pillars: religious African Americans and Hispanics and secular (mostly well-educated) whites. Meanwhile, the GOP coalition remains centered on white Christians, especially evangelical Protestants, who still compose about one-third of all Republicans and an even larger share of GOP primary voters (even as they have fallen to about one-sixth of the total population in the Pew data). <br><br>The debate over how to treat religious institutions during the pandemic shows how all the pressures in modern politics push to further extend that difference.  <br><br>A pandemic battlefield <br><br>It's easy to see the Republican efforts to minimize constraints on religious gatherings alienating secular voters who view those policies, along with Laser, as favoring religion over science and public health. It's equally easy to imagine some devout voters, along with Shackelford, viewing the push to include religion in any restrictions as just another step in a long-term Democratic drive to extend government control over religious institutions, as in, for example, attempts to deny religious objections to participating in same-sex weddings. <br><br>The coronavirus crisis \"could very well\" exacerbate the religious divide between the parties, notes Green, of the University of Akron. The key question, he says, is \"how do existing divisions play out under the pressure of the crisis?\" <br><br>During the coronavirus pandemic, the critical battlefield for this conflict has been the question of whether to exempt religious services from state limits on large gatherings. Those exemptions have not entirely followed party lines. Republican governors in Ohio, Indiana and Maryland have banned or severely limited in-person church services. And to varying degrees, Democratic governors -- including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Connecticut -- have provided exemptions for religious gatherings. <br><br>Yet Democratic governors have consistently been firmer in discouraging such gatherings, even if they have not banned them (either by choice or because they believe they lack the authority to do so). Just before Easter, Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for instance, told a radio station that holding in-person services \"is reckless, and it is dangerous and is only going to prolong the suffering that we're confronting as a state. It is just downright dangerous, irresponsible, and frankly it's infuriating.\"  <br><br>Meanwhile, some Republican governors -- such as Ron DeSantis in Florida and Greg Abbott in Texas -- have stirred confusion by issuing statewide stay-at-home orders that appeared to preempt ordinances from local officials, usually Democrats, including religious services in bans on large gatherings. (Dallas maintained a ban on religious gatherings for Easter, Mayor Eric Johnson told me; Harris County (Houston) loosened its restrictions in line with the governor's order.) In stark contrast to Whitmer's language, US Attorney General William Barr, in an interview on Fox News last week, expressed fundamental skepticism about state laws that included churches in limits on gatherings.  <br><br>\"A free society depends on a vibrant religious life by the people,\" Barr said. \"So anytime that's encroached upon by the government, I'm very, very concerned.\" <br><br>Most in-person services on hold <br><br>Across all faiths, it appears that the vast majority of religious institutions have suspended in-person worship, even in the jurisdictions that still permit it. In a statement on Sunday, Beshear said 99.8% of religious institutions in Kentucky complied with the ban on in-person services -- just seven churches across the state did not. <br><br>An unknown number of religious institutions held drive-in services on Sunday in which parishioners remained in their cars. Shackelford clearly distinguished between such proceedings, which his group has gone to court to defend against proposed government restrictions, and in-person services, which he said local governments would be within their rights to ban on health grounds. Courts, he said, have made clear that protecting public health can be a \"compelling interest\" sufficient to overcome the First Amendment right to freedom of religion.  <br><br>\"As long as they are treating everybody the same, I don't think anybody is going to have success\" in challenging such prohibitions on in-person services, Shackelford said.  <br><br>By contrast, his group, suing on behalf of the On Fire Christian Church, won a court ruling last week from a Trump-appointed federal district judge blocking what the organization interpreted as a ban on drive-in services in Louisville, Kentucky; those services were held on Sunday, Shackelford said. <br><br>The very few churches that defied local orders against in-person services tended to be evangelical or fundamentalist Protestant congregations, including the Maryville Baptist Church in Kentucky, Cavalry Baptist Church in Kansas and the Life Tabernacle Church in Louisiana. Another leading evangelical minister, Jerry Falwell Jr., reopened his Liberty University in Virginia last month until state officials closed it down.  <br><br>That pattern extends a trend visible in public opinion polls. Some surveys that allow for comparisons along religious lines have found that white evangelical Protestants stand apart from other major groups in their attitudes toward the coronavirus outbreak. <br><br>In polling conducted late last month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, more than two-fifths of white evangelical Protestants described the outbreak as only a minor threat to the health of the US population; that was a larger share than among other major religious groups, such as white Catholics, African American Protestants or those who described themselves as belonging to no religious tradition. White evangelical Protestants were also much less likely than any other groups to say Americans were not taking the threat seriously enough and much more likely to say both that the media was exaggerating the danger and that they approved of President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis. <br><br>Opposing sides, same view <br><br>Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of the book \"The End of White Christian America,\" says this response reflects deeper suspicions that are widespread in the white evangelical community. In polling the institute did several years ago, white evangelical Protestants were much more likely than any other religious group except one to say that science conflicted with their religious beliefs and to agree that scientists were disrespectful of religion. African American Protestants expressed similar views about science, Jones notes, but they diverge from the white Protestants in that they tend to be more trusting of government.  <br><br>To Jones, those differing attitudes about government -- reinforced by their more skeptical posture toward Trump -- help explain why religiously devout African Americans have not expressed the skepticism about the outbreak evident in polling among white evangelicals, much less attempted to hold in-person church services in the same manner. <br><br>\"White evangelicals have got the skepticism about science and they have the skepticism about big government and they have Donald Trump sowing doubts about how serious this whole thing is and whether we are overreacting,\" Jones said. <br><br>Tellingly, both Shackelford and Laser, from opposite perspectives see the struggles over limits on religious gatherings during the outbreak as just the latest step in a conflict that has been building for years -- and is likely to continue cresting for many years more.  <br><br>Shackelford worries that as the share of Americans who identify with any organized religious faith declines, \"there is less of an understanding of why religious freedom is so important.\" Laser, in turn, fears that conservative religious leaders -- a \"political movement that is disguised as a religious movement,\" in her words -- will try to mobilize the devout behind conservative politicians such as Trump by promoting \"this idea that religious people are besieged in American society and need special privileges because of that disadvantage.\" <br><br>Overall, most leaders of all denominations have supported the stay-at-home orders issued in more than 40 states to combat the virus' spread. But the fact that questions about the balance between religious liberty and civic welfare have persisted even at a moment of such intense national crisis shows the durability of these conflicts. None of them will likely become easier to solve as America's religious landscape grows more fractured and diverse in the years ahead. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "199", "title": "For China's aggressive new diplomacy, coronavirus is both a crisis and an opportunity"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "180", "title": "Asia may have been right about coronavirus and face masks, and the rest of the world is coming around"}, {"id": "146", "title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists"}]}, "91": {"title": "Mediterranean diet slows cognitive impairment, studies say", "content": "Worried about your mental function during stressful times? You can reduce your risk for cognitive impairment by half if you closely follow the Mediterranean diet, known for its emphasis on vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, according to two new studies.   <br><br>\"People with the higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had almost a 45% to 50% reduction in the risk of having an impaired cognitive function,\" said lead author Dr. Emily Chew, who directs the Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications (DECA) at the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. <br><br>\"The evidence continues to mount that you are what you eat when it comes to brain health,\" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, who directs the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at NewYork-Presbyterian's Weill Cornell Medicine Center.  <br><br>\"Anyone can take control of their brain health today and lower their risk of cognitive impairment through simple dietary choices,\" added Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. <br><br>Closely following the diet was defined as eating fish twice a week, as well as regularly consuming fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and olive oil while reducing consumption of red meat and alcohol. <br><br>The risk for cognitive decline increased as the levels of adherence dropped, Chew said. <br><br>\"There was a dose response to following the diet that was consistent in both studies,\" Chew said. \"Those who had the highest adherence to the diet had better protection than those who are in the second tier, who had more cognitive protection than those in the last tier.\" <br><br>The Mediterranean diet didn't appear to slow cognitive decline in people with the ApoE gene, which dramatically raises the risk for Alzheimer's disease, Chew said. <br><br>But when the study looked at just the levels of fish consumption, eating fish twice a week did slow the decline in people with the gene, Chew said. At 10 years into the study, \"we could actually see that there was a difference when fish consumption was high. That progression rate did not go down as fast,\" she said. <br><br>\"In this study, while the Mediterranean diet overall decreased risk, the strongest factor to really move the needle was regular fish consumption,\" said Isaacson, who is also a trustee of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation.  <br><br>\"While this was a longer-term study, these results parallel findings from our clinical research in the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic, where people who made dietary and other lifestyle changes showed cognitive improvements in 18 months,\" he said. \"Future studies will help to clarify how long a person needs to make a dietary change before seeing an impact on cognitive outcomes.\" <br><br>A long history of diet's effect on eyes <br><br>The studies analyzed data from two major eye disease studies, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2, which followed the diets of some 8,000 people with and without macular degeneration over 10 years. Cognition was also tested at various intervals. <br><br>Why would researchers use an eye study to investigate the effect of diet on cognition? <br><br>\"The retina is an extension of the brain,\" Chew said. \"A third of your brain functions for vision and the retina lines the eyeball and travels back via an optic nerve all the way to the brain.\" <br><br>That's why it made sense that any antioxidants which might improve the retina might also improve the brain, she said. <br><br>\"We thought, 'well, you know, we probably should look at oxidative stress and diet for cataracts and macular degeneration.' It turns out that it was an important study,\" Chew said. <br><br>Early results from AREDS, published in 2001, found that people who ate diets high in fish and vegetables had less age-related macular degeneration over time. That's because of two important antioxidants that are not naturally produced in the body: lutein and zeaxanthin. <br><br>Responsible for the bright colors of vegetables, lutein and zeaxanthin are found in all vegetables, but especially good sources of these antioxidants are green, leafy vegetables such as kale, parsley, spinach, broccoli and peas. <br><br>Once in the body, lutein and zeaxanthin travel to the retinas at the back of the eye. There they help filter harmful high-energy blue light wavelengths that can damage the cells of the eye. <br><br>The study found that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet helped in reducing the risk of macular degeneration through all stages. <br><br>\"If you have early disease, it prevents you from going to the next stage; and if you have more intermediate stage, it prevents you from going to the late stage. It's actually very interesting,\" she said. <br><br>A later study element included giving study participants the antioxidant vitamins C, E, beta carotene and zinc.  <br><br>\"There was also a reduction and progression to late-stage disease macular degeneration. So this was one of the successful stories about oxidative stress vitamins,\" said Chew. <br><br>While the AREDS study did not find a positive effect of antioxidants on cataracts, studies since then have shown a moderately reduced risk of age-related cataracts in older women. <br><br>How to start the Mediterranean diet  <br><br>Want to jump on the Mediterranean diet bandwagon and protect your brain as well as your eyes?  <br><br>Experts say the easiest way to start is to replace one thing at a time. For example, replace refined grains with whole grains by choosing whole wheat bread and pasta and swapping white rice with brown or wild rice. <br><br>Cook one meal each week based on beans, whole grains and vegetables, using herbs and spices to add punch. No meat allowed. When one night a week is a breeze, add two, and build your non-meat meals from there. <br><br>On the Mediterranean diet, cheese and yogurt show up daily to weekly, in moderate portions; chicken and eggs are okay on occasion, but the use of other meats and sweets is very limited.  <br><br>When you eat meat, have small amounts. For a main course, that means no more than 3 ounces of chicken or lean meat. Better yet: Use small pieces of chicken or slices of lean meat to flavor a veggie-based meal, such as a stir fry.  <br><br>Fish is king in the Mediterranean diet, and is eaten at least twice a week. <br><br>\"Fatty fish like wild salmon, sardines, albacore tuna, lake trout and mackerel are loaded with brain healthy Omega-3 fatty acids which nourish the brain cells,\" Isaacson said. <br><br>Focus on fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. Add whole grains and fruit to every meal, but use nuts and seeds as a garnish or small snack due to their high calorie and fat content. <br><br>Eat a lot of veggies and use all kinds and colors to get the broadest range of nutrients, phytochemicals and fiber. Cook, roast or garnish them with herbs and a bit of extra virgin olive oil.  <br><br>If fish is the king, olive oil is the queen in the Mediterranean diet -- stay away from coconut and palm oil, experts say. Even though they are plant-based, those oils are high in saturated fats that will raise bad cholesterol.  <br><br>Adopting the fare of the sunny region will also help with healthy weight loss, while reducing the risk for diabetes, depression, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke and some cancers.  <br><br>All that and a healthier brain and eyes too? What's to lose? <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Trump can't simply force them to open up. <br><br>And the administration itself appears far short of the readiness required to reopen the country safely. Mass testing capabilities needed to underwrite a staged return to normal life before the pandemic is contained are nowhere near needed levels. <br><br>There is also no sign of a government plan for how vital functions like air and surface transport can safely resume without triggering a new wave of mass infections. <br><br>Trump, however, appears increasingly keen to get everyone back to work, or at least is laying the groundwork to blame others if it can't happen, once again suggesting amid criticism of his leadership that states, and not Washington, should be in the lead. <br><br>\"Governors, get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing. More than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks!\" the President tweeted on Sunday evening.One of the top US public health experts, Robert Redfield, who heads the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, appeared to endorse a gradual reopening. <br><br>\"This pandemic has affected different parts of the country differently,\" Redfield said on NBC's \"Today Show.\" <br><br>\"We're looking at the data very carefully, county by county by county, and we will be assessing that,\" Redfield said. He added that before the US can start to get back to normal there needed to be greater capacity to identify, isolate and trace coronavirus cases through testing. <br><br>Trump also stoked fresh speculation about the standing of top health experts in his administration when he retweeted a call Sunday evening to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease specialist, who has publicly aired criticism of Trump's initial handling of the crisis. <br><br>No one says Trump's looming decision is easy. And heated debates are already occurring inside the administration over the issue. All public office holders must balance the devastating consequences of the government shutdown that threatens to trigger an economic depression with the need to stop a resurgence of the virus when hotspot areas pass their peak of infections. <br><br>But the lack of specifics so far -- even as Trump's target date of May 1 approaches -- will spark concern over whether a President who was negligent in recognizing the initial threat from the virus is up to presiding over the next critical stage in the fight. <br><br>The debate on reopening is heating up after the US passed 22,000 Covid-19-related deaths and at least half a million known cases. Not every country is testing the same way -- and there have been questions about whether every nation has been truthful -- but when it comes to the raw numbers, the US is currently the worst afflicted country in the world. <br><br>But there is increasing optimism that the rate of increase of infections is flattening and the US will fall short of the 100,000 to 240,000 deaths previously cited in models by the White House. Hopes that the death toll could be kept to the lower, but still very tragic, 60,000 range rest on the assumption that social distancing will remain in place through May. <br><br>In the days ahead, the President could be pulled one way by the advice of his top health advisers and in an opposite direction by economic aides conscious that the longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it will be that jobs will permanently disappear. There are strong calls from conservative commentators who influence Trump for the economy to be unleashed. <br><br>Fauci: No flick of the switch <br><br>Fauci offered some qualified hope but also a warning on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. He said it might be possible by the end of the month to judge whether some social-distancing measures could be eased. <br><br>\"It's going to be depending where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak that you have already experienced, and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced,\" Fauci told Jake Tapper. <br><br>\"It is not going to be a light switch that we say, OK, it is now June, July or whatever, click, the light switch goes back on,\" Fauci said. <br><br>Such a phased and limited initial opening appears likely to fall well short of the President's hopes for a swift economic rebound.   <br><br>\"It would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country,\" Trump said last week. On Fox News on Saturday, he said the decision was the toughest of his life.  <br><br>\"There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. It's going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct, also,\" the President said. <br><br>Trump's willingness to rely on instinct will trouble his critics, given his instinct to downplay the virus for weeks earlier this year.   <br><br>Fauci appeared to incur Trump's ire on \"State of the Union\" Sunday morning when he admitted that there had been \"a lot of pushback\" to calls inside the administration for earlier social distancing. <br><br>\"I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,\" Fauci said. <br><br>Hours later, Trump retweeted a user who said it was \"Time to #FireFauci.\" The tweet suggested that Fauci mistakenly downplayed the initial threat of coronavirus to the US in late February when he said the \"country as a whole ... still remains at low risk,\" though the infectious disease expert was referring specifically to an outbreak in Washington state and qualified that \"this is an evolving situation.\" <br><br>Mass testing needed for American life to come back <br><br>Several think tanks and experts have released detailed plans for how to transition from the current state of shutdown to a reopening of shops, businesses, transport, sports events and large scale social gatherings. <br><br>The studies, including by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, the liberal Center for American Progress and Harvard University's Safra Center for Ethics, sketch an intricate conditions-based dance of openings when benchmarks for falling infections are reached in successive states. <br><br>They rely on a massive expansion of testing, contact tracing and isolation \u2014 possibly with cellphone apps that may allow some sectors of the population to begin returning to work. <br><br>But the administration has for weeks failed to deliver on the expansion of testing that would be required under such plans. <br><br>The President boasts each day of testing programs that have now reached 2 million Americans. But under most reopening plans, several million people per day may need to be tested to prevent a new spike in infections that could overwhelm hospitals. <br><br>Currently, there are insufficient diagnostic tests to cover all front-line health workers -- or many Americans who fall sick. And test results take days to come back in some cases. <br><br>Public health experts are also calling for a surge in serology blood-based testing that can identify antibodies in a patient's body developed to fight the disease, which could allow that person to return to normal life. <br><br>Last week, the President said a nationwide testing program was unnecessary before the economy was opened. <br><br>\"Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes,\" Trump said. \"We're talking about 325 million people and that's not going to happen.\" <br><br>Former Vice President Joe Biden is targeting the paucity of testing as he rolls out his own plan to tackle the virus while stepping up his general election campaign against Trump. <br><br>\"We should be running multiple times the number of diagnostic tests we're performing right now,\" Biden wrote in a New York Times op-ed published on Sunday. <br><br>\"This isn't rocket science; it's about investment and execution. We are now several months into this crisis, and still this administration has not squarely faced up to the 'original sin' in its failed response \u2014 the failure to test.\" <br><br>Trump can't order the economy reopened <br><br>Owing to the US federal system, Trump can't simply order people back to work. <br><br>Governors and mayors who closed their jurisdictions down will make that choice.  <br><br>\"We're going to make the decisions that safeguard New Mexicans,\" the southwestern state's Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told CNN on Sunday. <br><br>\"If we had better national strategies and universal testing and software-based contract tracing, then we could really figure out when opening makes sense and we could start to do that in the country,\" Lujan Grisham said. <br><br>New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday acknowledged Americans want life back on track. But he warned that reopening must be adopted by adjacent states for it to work properly and to keep the virus under control. <br><br>\"Nobody wants to pick between a public health strategy and an economic strategy. And as governor of the state, (I'm) not going to pick one over the other. We need a public health strategy that is safe, that is consistent with an economic strategy,\" Cuomo said. <br><br>Another local official in a similar position is Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser. <br><br>\"We don't expect our peak medical surge to happen until June,\" Bowser said on CNN's \"Inside Politics.\" <br><br>\"And so we continue to look for ways, certainly, that we would be able to turn on our economy slowly. But I don't think that's going to be on May the 1st,\" Bowser said. <br><br>Still, in some areas of the nation that have been less afflicted by the virus than the big coastal conurbations, officials are hopeful that they can safely begin to move forward. <br><br>Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson defended his decision not to impose a statewide stay-at-home order Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" arguing that the state's lack of population density meant that it was unnecessary. <br><br>\"Right now, what we're doing proves to be successful, this targeted approach,\" Hutchinson said. <br><br>This story has been updated to include Trump's retweet calling for Fauci to be fired. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "117", "title": "Aides hope to give Trump his economic 'big bang' starting in May"}, {"id": "50", "title": "Divisions on battling coronavirus deepen as Trump and Southern states push opening"}, {"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}]}, "95": {"title": "Deadly tornadoes in the South cause 'catastrophic' damage", "content": "Tornadoes in Mississippi and Louisiana have caused \"catastrophic\" damage and at least seven deaths after touching down Sunday, emergency officials say. <br><br>So far, officials say hundreds of structures have been damaged by the storms. <br><br>Two people are dead in Lawrence County, Mississippi, according to Monticello Fire Chief Lyle Berard, saying there were reports of two tornadoes in the area. <br><br>\"It's pretty bad,\" he said \"We have downed trees and multiple homes with major damage.\"  <br><br>The Mississippi State Emergency Management Agency confirmed the Lawrence County deaths.

They were about 200,000 miles away from Earth on the way to the moon.  <br><br>Everything was about to change, ultimately forcing the crew to abort their mission.   <br><br>Here's what happened, according to newly released interviews with the NASA astronauts.  <br><br>The explosion <br><br>The astronauts had just finished a TV broadcast providing a tour of the lunar module that would land on the moon.  <br><br>On the ground in Houston's Mission Control center, Apollo 13 flight director Gene Kranz and his team were about to hand off to another shift.  <br><br>In audio from the mission, the crew was asked to stir up the liquid oxygen tanks. Swigert flipped a switch.  <br><br>Then, an explosion crackled over the audio from Apollo 13's command module. \"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Lovell said.  <br><br>\"We heard this loud bang that reverberated with a little echo because the vehicles we're in were metal,\" Haise said in the new NASA documentary, \"Apollo 13: Home Safe.\"  <br><br>Haise compared it to being in a barrel that was hit on the side with a sledgehammer.  <br><br>When one of the oxygen tanks exploded, it ruptured another.  <br><br>Lovell recalled seeing that two of the three fuel cells, which develop oxygen, were gone.  <br><br>\"I drifted over to the window and looked out the window,\" Lovell recently told NASA's \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\" \"I can't tell you now why I did it, but when I did, I saw escaping at a high rate of speed a gaseous substance from the back of our spacecraft, and it dawned on me that yes, we had lost something. And then I looked at the oxygen gauges, and one read zero, and the other one was going down.\" <br><br>Apollo 13 was comprised of three main components. The command module housed the crew, acted as a control center and would enable them to return to Earth. The service module supplied oxygen, power, water, main propulsion and maneuvering systems for the spacecraft. And the lunar module would enable them to land on the moon.  <br><br>The explosion impacted the service module and effectively killed it, removing all of the necessary items it contained for the mission.  <br><br>As a result, the command module's power was dying. Without it, they couldn't return to Earth.  <br><br>The crew knew they would no longer be landing on the moon. Now they had to figure out how to get back to Earth.  <br><br>\"I was sick to my stomach with disappointment, because I knew pretty quick we had an aborted mission,\" Haise told NASA's \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\"  <br><br>The crew and Mission Control teams had to act quickly. The command module only had 15 minutes of power left, and they had to save the battery power reserves for re-entry. They worked to shift everything, including navigation, over from the command module to the lunar module during that short time. <br><br>It was meant to land on the moon and hold two men for two days. Ultimately, it would hold three men for four days when the astronauts and Mission Control both decided to use it as a \"lifeboat\" for the crew. <br><br>The crew had to make several burns, used as course corrections, to put them on the right path that would send them back towards Earth.  <br><br>To do that, Lovell, Haise and Swigert had to swing around the moon. The lunar module's engines, which would have helped it land and lift off from a lunar landing, were instead used to put it on that path that would use the moon's gravity and send it back toward Earth.  <br><br>On the back side of the moon, the astronauts lost contact with Mission Control, as expected.  <br><br>Lovell had seen the moon during his Apollo 8 mission. But Swigert and Haise were seeing it for the first time. They photographed it \"like tourists,\" Haise said.  <br><br>\"We were 130 miles above the surface, which gave us a larger span of the Moon to shoot,\" Haise told \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\" \"Farouk El-Baz, one of our trainers for lunar geology, in the lunar scene told us afterwards that we shot some very good pictures that had not been shot before. I think he was trying to make us feel good, that we had done something right on this mission.\" <br><br>Returning home <br><br>Another burn was needed after looping around the moon. Without it, the spacecraft would drift so far that the astronauts would miss the Earth in a wide swing.  <br><br>Then, the mission became about returning the astronauts home as soon as possible. With limited resources, their time was running out. They shut down everything but necessary life support systems in the lunar module. The temperature dropped, reaching 38 degrees Fahrenheit on the day they were expected to land on Earth.  <br><br>Haise recalled that water was everywhere. It built up on wiring, windows, the walls and instrument panels.  <br><br>To keep warm, Haise and Lovell donned the boots they would have worn on the surface of the moon. Swigert put on his spare underwear. But they couldn't put on their spacesuits because it would trap any moisture inside.  <br><br>There was also the issue of the carbon dioxide the men were exhaling into the cramped quarters of the lunar module. Their carbon dioxide canister was quickly filling.  <br><br>Mission Control engineers scrambled to come up with a solution and sent up the instructions to the astronauts. Using materials they had on the spacecraft like plastic bags, tape and cardboard, they were able to build a connection between lithium hydroxide canisters in the lunar module and command module systems. <br><br>The lithium hydroxide canisters were able to clear the carbon dioxide and within an hour, the carbon dioxide levels in the lunar module dropped.  <br><br>\"The three of us put the thing together, and by God, it worked,\" Lovell told \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\" \"And so, it was a perfect example of team work, and thinking sort of outside the box. But also slowing down and not trying to rush things. And we got rid of the carbon dioxide to safely get home, otherwise that would have been the end of us.\" <br><br>On the ground, Mission Control teams ran simulators to determine how the astronauts could reenter Earth's atmosphere and land. None of their previous simulations leading up to the mission had prepared for this.  <br><br>They also had to power up the command module again, jettison the dead service module and move from the lunar module back to the command module so they could lose the lunar lander, too. The lunar module, their lifeboat, had no heat shield and would be useless in re-entry.  <br><br>As they jettisoned the service module, Lovell took photos.  <br><br>\"There's one whole side of that spacecraft missing,\" he can be heard saying in mission audio. He could see material hanging out into space from the base to the engines.  <br><br>The astronauts had to adjust the angle of the spacecraft to the precise two degrees needed to keep from bouncing off the Earth's atmosphere or burning upon re-entry, Lovell said. And they had to do it without a computer or display system.  <br><br>Using the Earth and sun's positions for orientation and pitch, the three astronauts worked together to make corrections for the angle of entry.  <br><br>When the spacecraft's parachutes opened after re-entry, applause crackled over the audio from Mission Control.  <br><br>Looking back, flight directors Kranz and Glynn Lunney realized that everyone did what needed to be done. They had worked together on previous missions. They were comfortable with one another. And they trusted each other.  <br><br>\"It never really converged to the point where you felt you really had total control of what was going on,\" Kranz said in \"Apollo 13: Home Safe.\" \"About the time you turned the corner, something new would show up.\" <br><br>\"So it was a question of getting this entire world geared and orientated to one single job: get the crew home. And boy the teams worked out great,\" Kranz said.  <br><br>\"When it really happens, we didn't have to open any books to tell us what we had to deal with,\" Lunney said. \"We didn't need coaching, it just happened. We pulled that off.\" <br><br>Looking back <br><br>Lovell said that positivity kept the astronauts going during the aborted mission. He and Haise reflected on the journey 50 years later during a recent reminiscence with NASA's \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\"  <br><br>\"You have to look at what you've got, and how can you get home,\" Lovell said. \"And as long as we could get over one crisis after another, we kept, you know, thinking positive, and until we finally made the landing. <br><br>\"The explosion occurred at just the right time to make sure that we could-- or to get our return safely. If the explosion occurred, and we'd already gotten to the high velocity to go to the Moon, we'd probably have had to go around the moon to come back home again, and I don't think the lunar module would have had the electrical capacity to get us home. If the explosion occurred once we were in lunar orbit, or you know, around the lunar surface, well then, we would have been stranded at the moon.\" <br><br>Ironically, the mission, deemed a \"successful failure\" because the astronauts were safely returned to Earth even though their lunar landing was aborted, brought a renewed interest in NASA and spaceflight for the public. Previous successful flights, like Apollo 11, had made lunar landings seem more normal, Lovell said.  <br><br>Previous lessons learned from the ill-fated Apollo 1 mission also saved the astronauts on Apollo 13. After the Apollo 1 fire, significant redesign, including rewiring, was done on the command module. It meant that the wiring was waterproofed in the command and lunar modules. This prevent any electrical shortages when the water built up as temperatures dropped, Haise said.  <br><br>But the ultimate lesson the men carried away from Apollo 13 was what true teamwork can achieve.  <br><br>\"I really learned that you can't suddenly have a problem, and then just you know, close your eyes and hope there's a miracle coming on, because the miracle is something you have to do yourself, or having people to help you,\" Lovell said.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "108", "title": "How the government delayed coronavirus testing"}, {"id": "64", "title": "In 1911, another epidemic swept through China.

Not liking these #pandemicdreams,\" posted Sarah Schachner on Twitter on March 23.  <br><br>\"I dreamed that I encountered a duck hanging out in deep snow,\" wrote John Johnson in a Tweet on April 8. \"I asked the duck 'if I were your chickie would you take care of me?' and the duck replied 'yes.' It was very reassuring. #pandemic dreams\"  <br><br>According to experts, these cryptic responses are normal. Our brains' way of understanding the stressful information we take in during the day can manifest in nightmares.  <br><br>Or we might dream of past chapters in life that were less stressful. <br><br>\"This [pandemic] is something that they've never experienced before,\" said sleep medicine expert Dr. Meir Kryger, professor of pulmonary medicine and clinical professor of nursing at Yale School of Medicine.  <br><br>\"And it's possible that their brains are trying to find a time when things weren't like that. It's like when sometimes people are trying to fall asleep and they can't turn their minds off. They will try to think about a time when things were better.\" <br><br>The science behind bizarre quarantine dreams <br><br>Researchers still don't know why we dream, said Jason Ellis, a psychology professor at Northumbria University and director of the Northumbria Centre for Sleep Research.  <br><br>But there are a few theories.  <br><br>\"There's the evolutionary theory that says we use dreams to try out different scenarios in a safe environment\" that might be challenging or threatening in real life, Ellis said.   <br><br>Another hypothesis is the memory consolidation idea, he added, which suggests that when we're dreaming, we're taking in the information we've collected throughout the day to either create new memories or sort unfamiliar information into existing knowledge that informs our reasoning.  <br><br>\"When we look at people's brains when they're sleeping, you can actually tell differences between when they're dreaming and when they're not. And we can certainly see that brain activity changes as a function of dreams,\" Ellis said. <br><br>There's another dream theory -- the mood regulatory function theory -- that says dreams are for problem solving through emotional issues that we experience.  <br><br>The stress of a pandemic -- with its family, work and mental troubles -- can result in dreams that are equally upsetting, as dreams can not only help us cope but also reflect reality.  <br><br>Vivid dreams may serve as coping mechanisms, or our brain's way of processing novel circumstances.  <br><br>\"What we do know is that it's patterns of sensory information that are being relayed in the brain. So you've got sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. What's most interesting about dreams is that they're predominantly going to be sight-based or hearing-based,\" Ellis said.  <br><br>These dreams mostly occur during REM  -- or rapid eye movement -- sleep, our deepest phase of sleep that occurs in intervals during the night and is characterized by rapid eye movements, more dreaming and bodily movement and faster heart rate and breathing.  <br><br>\"So the fantastical dreams people are reporting are most likely to be quite REM-based,\" Ellis said.  <br><br>Developing unusual habits  <br><br>What's odd about some of our pandemic dreams isn't only the content of them or the fact that we're having them.  <br><br>It's that we're remembering them, which isn't typical -- normally, we'd forget most of our dreams shortly after waking up for the day. <br><br>Drinking more alcohol typically suppresses memories of dreams. But drinking more often can also wake us up more during that deep phase of sleep in which our brains are most active, thus making the dreams more memorable, Ellis said.  <br><br>Binge watching popular and favorite TV shows with exciting stories seems like a fine idea for entertainment while we're staying indoors. And we may also may feel the urge to stay updated on the news from the moment we awake till we fall asleep. <br><br>But doing these things for hours before bed can contribute to a restless night ahead, Kryger said.  <br><br>We could also be having strange dreams because our routines are all out of sorts.  <br><br>\"Usually when we've had to go into the office or we've had to go to work, there's been a very strong structure about what time you get up and leave; we would probably put ourselves to bed at a certain time so we could get up and get ready and do all of these things,\" Ellis said.  <br><br>Those things don't exist quite to the same degree for many of us as they had previously. Routines have suddenly become harder to establish and maintain and the motivation to go to sleep at the same time each night may be gone, which can upset the internal processes necessary for good sleep, Ellis said.  <br><br>Not only have our routines changed in terms of work, but our social practices have switched as well. Since we're social creatures, we've creatively adapted to new ways of interacting with our friends and family, such as virtual dinners, movie watching and live streams on social media. <br><br>Interacting in these ways in person can be perfectly healthy. But the light exposure from screens hours before bed, no matter the purpose, can be detrimental to ensuring a good night's sleep, Ellis said.  <br><br>Preventing restless sleep <br><br>It can be difficult to adopt positive, productive habits during these stressful times. But trying your best to still maintain good sleep hygiene can not only help ensure a good night's rest, but also prevent the development of more serious problems in the long run.  <br><br>Healthy sleep habits include signing off from screens two to four hours before bed and trying to turn in at the same time each night. Turning off the news for a little while before bed can also help cut back on the anxiety that may present as stressful dreams, Kryger said.  <br><br>\"We know that when somebody is not sleeping very well, it creates an incredible risk for them to develop depression in the future or develop post-traumatic stress disorder in the future,\" Ellis said.  <br><br>\"So I think what we need to do right now is focus on managing people's sleep to try to prevent a lot of psychological illnesses that are going to come up nine, 10 months down the line.\"  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "103", "title": "How a pandemic prepares us for exploring and living on Mars"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}, {"id": "222", "title": "The dangerous morality behind the 'Open it Up' movement"}, {"id": "50", "title": "Divisions on battling coronavirus deepen as Trump and Southern states push opening"}]}, "103": {"title": "How a pandemic prepares us for exploring and living on Mars", "content": "As people around the world rethink many aspects of their lives to combat the coronavirus pandemic, NASA experts say that knowledge and understanding of how to stay safe and healthy will help us prepare for landing on another planet.  <br><br>After all, NASA's robotic explorers are already on Mars paving the way for future astronaut-led missions to the Red Planet -- and those expeditions will require a level of safety planning that would put a germophobe to shame. <br><br>Astronauts don't want to carry Earth bacteria to the surface of Mars because it could contaminate the environment, or even show up as a false positive of life on the planet. And they also have to be careful to quarantine any samples returned. <br><br>It requires a level of care and caution we haven't had to exercise in our daily lives -- until now.  <br><br>During the Apollo program, astronauts were quarantined before and after moon landings for weeks in case they encountered pathogens on the lunar surface. Samples returned from the moon were treated with the same level of care as biohazards.  <br><br>Now we know that the astronauts didn't pick up any diseases during their moon walks, and there's no life that we know of on the moon. The surface is hit by micrometeorites and radiation, with no atmosphere to protect it.  <br><br>But it was a smart move because humans were exploring the unknown and they wanted to protect the astronauts.  <br><br>It's also part of the reason why COSPAR, the global Committee on Space Research, exists. It was formed in 1958 to further research, exploration and the peaceful use of outer space through international cooperation, according to the COSPAR mission statement.  <br><br>COSPAR has a planetary protection policy (PDF) ensuring that the world's space agencies protect the safety of our planet as well as any that we explore.  <br><br>\"The Planetary Protection Requirements are an international NATO treaty, ratified by COSPAR,\" Moogega Stricker, Planetary Protection Lead Engineer for NASA's Perseverance rover mission, told CNN in June. \"It's an international policy that we have to abide by. Agencies around the world have to make sure their hardware and their spacecraft is clean enough.\" <br><br>This governs the level of sterilization that spacecraft and robotic explorers endure before launch. The rovers and landers were assembled in NASA's \"cleanrooms,\" where the only people allowed to enter are covered head-to-toe in white coveralls called \"bunny suits,\" complete with face shields. <br><br>And even more precautions will be taken when humans are sent to explore Mars.  <br><br>Here's how NASA prepares for safe exploration. <br><br>Returning samples from Mars <br><br>NASA's next generation of Martian rover, named Perseverance, will land on Mars in Jezero Crater next year. The site is where a lake once existed 3.5 billion years ago. Perseverance will collect samples and seal them up to preserve them until they can be returned to Earth, hopefully sometime in the 2020s.  <br><br>Stricker's job is to \"make sure that we don't contaminate Mars with Earth germs when we go and explore that planet.\" <br><br>In her lab, the team take samples that they collect from the spacecraft and grow them in Petri dishes to see how clean the spacecraft really is before launch. They look for evidence of spores that can attach to the spacecraft. <br><br>\"We look for these seeds that certain microbes can produce, and those are the things that would survive the journey in deep space, the harsh environments -- that's why we look for those on our Petri dishes every single day when we swab the spacecraft,\" Stricker said.  <br><br>They also look for viable organisms, like E. coli, that can live on skin. Although something like this can't survive without a host, if it was found on the Martian surface it could be confused with fossilized life,  Stricker said. <br><br>The room where the rover is constructed is \"cleaner than an operating room, cleaner than a lot of the things we interact with,\" she said.  <br><br>Parts of the spacecraft that will actually touch the Martian surface are sterilized, fired at 662 degrees Fahrenheit. \"It's just the cleanest thing you're ever going to see,\" Stricker said. This includes collection tubes for samples on Mars. <br><br>Perseverance will collect rock, mineral and soil samples -- and those soil samples could even include microfossils from ancient organisms that may have once lived in the lake. The data it collects may be able to help scientists know if they've found a biosignature on Mars. <br><br>\"On the science side, we're really thinking about new discoveries we can make on the surface and how [that] will inform what we learn when we get the samples back,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist for the rover at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, also speaking to CNN in June. \"Our job is to find the best samples, collect and store them, and place them on the surface.\"  <br><br>The rover will pick up the samples, put them inside its body and seal them in tight metal tubes that were designed to withstand the Martian environment -- at least, that's the hope of NASA engineers. The samples will be dropped at specific collection sites so they can be retrieved later. <br><br>\"Combining an understanding of the composition of the rocks, but also the very fine detail that we see in the rocks and the textures, can make a powerful case for ancient signs of life,\" Stack Morgan said.  <br><br>\"We know that ancient Mars was habitable. But we haven't yet been able to show that we have signs, real signs, of ancient life yet. And with our instrument suite, we think we can make real advances towards that on the surface.\" <br><br>Returning the samples is a challenge down the road, and NASA is already planning for it. The earliest mission that could go back to Mars to retrieve the samples is set for the 2026-2027 timeframe, Stack Morgan said.  <br><br>\"This is a huge endeavor for the human species, and it'll take cooperation from more than just our own space program,\" Stack Morgan said. \"Once the resources are there, we can develop the technology. It's getting the buy-in from international partners and from our own space administration and government to really make this happen.\" <br><br>The new rover will also be on a mission to lay the groundwork for future human exploration.  <br><br>\"We're very much thinking about how Mars could be inhabited, how humans could come to Mars and make use of the resources that we have there in the Martian environment today,\" said Stack Morgan. \"We send our robotic scouts first to learn about these other places, hopefully for us to prepare the way for us to go ourselves.\" <br><br>Returning samples could also inform how, when and where we land humans on Mars.  <br><br>When Martian samples are returned to Earth and searched for evidence of life, they will be sent to biosafety level 4 laboratories, which are used to research pathogens that cause fatal diseases like coronavirus, said Jim Green, NASA's Chief Scientist.  <br><br>If life, ancient or existing, is found on Mars through studying these samples, the discovery will cause COSPAR members to change the COSPAR guidelines so we can \"come up with a way to explore Mars,\" Green said.  <br><br>And frankly, it would change everything. <br><br>\"It would mean that the possibilities now are endless for other potential civilizations or even microbial populations out there,\" Stricker said. \"It doesn't have to be intelligent and complex. Microbes are actually quite intelligent and complex and should be admired. So if we found signs of life, it will shift our idea of being alone, or where we stand, in this universe.\" <br><br>Humans on Mars <br><br>In a conversation this week hosted by non-profit organization Explore Mars, Inc., Green and Penelope Boston, Director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, considered how humans can safely explore Mars.  <br><br>Green's idea of a Mars mission includes landing in one spot and separately living in another and setting up an \"exploration zone.\" It allows the astronauts to work in a confined area on Mars and perform scientific experiments. He suggests that future missions land and live in the same spots created by that first mission. <br><br>\"It gives us a wonderful opportunity over several decades of going there, building and developing things at that site,\" said Green. \"We can gain a deep understanding of what Mars is all about.\" <br><br>So far, robotic exploration has revealed that the similarities between soil on Earth and Mars is strong. But human exploration and experiments could reveal even more.  <br><br>If life is found on Mars, Boston's research has led her to believe that it will be deep beneath the surface. Recent studies have shown that life can exist in rock cracks below Earth's ocean floor, and it could be the same in the Martian subsurface. <br><br>But care will need to be taken that any potential subsurface groundwater sources on Mars aren't contaminated by human exploration.  <br><br>\"I'd love to see boots on Mars, but I'm very aware of the deep ecology aspects of another biosphere,\" Boston said. \"How do we study and cohabit with it without doing damage? Luckily the surface environment is harsh. It's not entirely self-sterilizing, but it will do a lot to reduce contaminants.\"  <br><br>Stricker's job will evolve if humans land on Mars, as she'll need to develop stringent safety rules -- not unlike the ones we're implementing today.  <br><br>\"We have to make sure if there are people living there, for example, that their crops stay intact,\" she said. \"A lot of the things they bring along need to not be contaminated by weird bugs.\" <br><br>She compared it to flying from one country to another with certain restricted food items.  <br><br>\"We have to make sure there aren't any weird fruits, bacteria, fungus -- something that may contaminate the livelihood, the life supply that they have on Mars,\" she said. \"We want to make sure we do the best job at preserving whatever is native.\" <br><br>The original version of this story failed to note that two quotes from NASA scientists were given during a June interview with CNN's Amanda Sealy.

Andrew Cuomo announced the state had its lowest daily jump in hospitalizations \"since this nightmare started.\" <br><br>New York, the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak, has more than 161,000  confirmed cases of its own but had only about 200 new hospitalizations Wednesday, the governor said. <br><br>\"You're not out of the woods,\" Cuomo said in a news conference Thursday. \"We've done some great things and we've saved lives because we've followed these policies (like staying at home).\"  <br><br>More than 465,300 known coronavirus cases and at least 16,672 deaths have been reported in the United States. States across the country have issued stay-at-home orders, leaving many workers idle and health care workers scrambling to treat the increasing number of patients. <br><br>But Wednesday also was the state's deadliest day of the outbreak, with 799 deaths. Cuomo has said deaths are a lagging indicator, because those who die tend to have been hospitalized the longest. <br><br>Cuomo was among several governors who said they were encouraged by the impact that social distancing is having against the spread of the virus. <br><br>Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said during a call with small business leaders that new hospitalizations dropped to their lowest point in two weeks. Meanwhile, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state has the lowest number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people compared to other southern states. <br><br>The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Ohio continues to increase but Gov. Mike DeWine said \"things are not as bad as they might have been\" because the number of people impacted by the virus is lower than previously projected. <br><br>\"So, is it time to celebrate? No,\" DeWine told reporters Thursday. \"The game is not over.\" <br><br>Ohio, Minnesota and New Mexico have extended their stay-at-home orders into May while national social distancing guidelines are currently running through at least April 30. <br><br>US to reach highest daily number of deaths Sunday, experts say <br><br>The Trump administration and health officials are navigating potentially competing circumstances: Hard economic news, as workers stay home; and indications that social distancing is helping to keep coronavirus deaths down. <br><br>Another 6.6 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits last week, data released Thursday show. This means more than 16.8 million Americans have sought unemployment aid since mid-March. <br><br>President Donald Trump is preparing to announce a second coronavirus task force focused solely on reopening the economy, multiple sources told CNN. <br><br>And over the past week, Trump's economic team advised him that even if the economy doesn't open all at once on May 1 -- a date some advisers want -- the administration should at least announce an estimated timeline. <br><br>While maintaining social distancing measures appears to be holding down the spread in some areas, experts say the country is not ready to shift to a more normal life yet. <br><br>Easing social distancing too soon risks \"a huge resurgence -- and much worse than what we've seen already,\" Crystal Watson, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins' public health school, told CNN on Thursday. <br><br>Watson co-authored a report suggesting prerequisites for reopening the economy, including a sustained reduction in cases for 14 days, and improved abilities to test people and monitor and trace cases. <br><br>The United States is set to reach its highest daily number of deaths on or around Sunday, according to models by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.  <br><br>The highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day came Wednesday with 1,922, according to data supplied by Johns Hopkins University. <br><br>The IHME estimated 60,415 in the US would die of coronavirus disease by August, assuming social-distancing policies continue through May. That projection is down from the figure that the model predicted earlier in the week: 82,000. <br><br>That decrease is thanks to the actions taken by Americans, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said. <br><br>\"What has been so remarkable, I think, to those of us that have been in the science field for so long,\" Birx said, \"is how important behavioral change is, and how amazing Americans are at adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes.\" <br><br>Some hospitals in hot spots such as Detroit and New York, however, still are straining to keep up with the weeks of influx in patients. Detroit's Sinai-Grace Hospital has been so overwhelmed, at least two people have died in its emergency room hallways before help can arrive, health care workers there told CNN. <br><br>Fauci speculates Americans could take summer vacations, but there are caveats <br><br>Americans have the potential to take summer vacations this year -- provided that the country continues aggressive mitigation efforts now and gets to a place where it can modify them, Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official said Thursday. <br><br>On \"CBS This Morning\" Thursday, Fauci was asked whether he could envision a typical summer with vacations, baseball games, weddings and family reunions.  <br><br>\"It can be in the cards,\" Fauci told CBS.   <br><br>But, he warned: \"When we pull back and try to open up the country ... we have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again,\" the country has a way to aggressively and effectively \"identify, isolate, contract trace and make sure we don't have those spikes we have now.\" <br><br>Moving toward normalcy will be gradual, and could be different by region, he said.  <br><br>\"Hopefully, by the time we get to the summer, we will have taken many steps in that direction\" that would allow some normalization. <br><br>Fauci has consistently stressed social distancing should be maintained now, and that the virus, not people's wishes, \"makes the timeline\" about when measures could be relaxed. <br><br>Judge rejects motion to release vulnerable Chicago inmates <br><br>A federal judge has denied a motion to order the immediate release of medically vulnerable detainees at the Cook County Jail in Chicago, where more than 400 people have tested positive for Covid-19.  <br><br>US District Judge Matthew Kennelly denied a request that two current detainees had filed but ordered Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart to provide face masks to all detainees, enact additional sanitation guidelines and promptly test inmates who have Covid-19 symptoms. <br><br>The Cook County Sherriff's Department said that operating the facility has \"become exceedingly more challenging\" during the pandemic but noted that \"much of what the court is requiring today has been well underway for weeks and even months in some cases.\" <br><br>The jail in Chicago is the largest known source of coronavirus infections in the US outside of medical facilities, according to the Cook County Sheriff's Office. <br><br>At least 276 detainees and 172 staff members at the Cook County Jail have tested positive for the virus, the county sheriff's office said Thursday. At least 21 of the detainees remain hospitalized and 36 have been moved to a recovery facility.  <br><br>A detainee died of apparent coronavirus complications, but the autopsy is pending, the sheriff's office said.  <br><br>The sheriff's department said Thursday that more than 1,247 detainees have been released since March 9 to reduce the spread of the virus. The jail complex currently houses 4,463 detainees.  <br><br>\"Jails in this country are petri dishes,\" said Toni Preckwinkle, Cook County Board president. \"It's very difficult in a jail to maintain social distancing.\" <br><br>In Washington state, violence erupted Wednesday after six inmates at Monroe Correctional Complex tested positive for coronavirus.  <br><br>It started with 100 inmates demonstrating in the recreation yard, and some inmates eventually caused damage to two housing units before guards brought the situation under control, officials said. <br><br>\"It is believed at this time that the incident was caused by recent positive test results of Covid-19 among six men within the Minimum Security Unit,\" the state Department of Corrections said. <br><br>In the California prison system, the number of inmates infected grew by more than seven times in a little more than a week and staff cases nearly tripled, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Wednesday.  <br><br>\"You have people in Italy dying, people in Spain dying, people in America dying, people are panic buying, people are concerned and people are scared,\" Samuel Brown, an inmate at California State Prison, Los Angeles County told CNN. \"And the truth of the matter is prisoners are people. So we're also afraid.\" <br><br>\"And there's a potential of us dying, too.\" <br><br>Philadelphia and DC expected to be new hot spots, official says <br><br>Philadelphia and Washington, DC, are expected to be new hot spots for the coronavirus pandemic, Birx said in a conference call with House Democrats Wednesday, according to a source on the call. <br><br>Birx added that the Philadelphia metropolitan area is seeing 1,400 cases per day. Washington has had about  500 new cases per day, and Baltimore has had 200 new cases daily. <br><br>Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday she has ordered grocery stores to post signs instructing shoppers to wear face masks, and to enter alone or with household members. <br><br>CNN's Holly Yan, Steve Almasy, Kevin Liptak, Kaitlan Collins, Paul P.

Many public health labs were waiting for the revised CDC tests, while commercial and clinical labs were barred from conducting their own tests unless they went through a complex, slow process of applying for their own \"emergency use authorization\" from the US Food and Drug Administration.  <br><br>As a result, the government squandered a critical month during which aggressive and widespread testing might greatly have reduced the speed and scale of the pandemic. <br><br>\"We really were... basically on a pause for a few weeks within the public health system,\" said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \"And meanwhile, the academic laboratories who had developed their own tests also were not able to test because the regulations didn't allow it at that time.\" <br><br>In a written response to CNN's inquiries about why the 2018 agreement wasn't fully implemented, the CDC confirmed that it didn't seek to bring commercial labs quickly into the testing mix. Rather, the agency said it decided to \"prioritize the nation's public health laboratories\" but keep the commercial labs \"well informed.\" Critics charge that the CDC and other federal agencies weren't quick enough to recognize the need for emergency action. <br><br>Bureaucratic inertia and disinterest <br><br>Public health labs are run by local, county or state governments and typically focus on detecting and providing surveillance of significant diseases, among other work. <br><br>The federal government \"made it very difficult for private labs, for university labs to make their own test based on certain regulatory hurdles,\" said Amesh Adalja, a physician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. <br><br>It shouldn't have been that way, Adalja and other scientists said. <br><br>The CDC's 2018 plan, created following the Zika outbreak two years earlier, was meant to prevent the very testing shortfalls and obstacles that have been unfolding since Covid-19 arrived in the US. <br><br>The agreement, obtained by CNN, calls for extensive coordination, planning, exercises and constant communication between the CDC, the public labs and the commercial sector. It was designed to leverage the full weight of the nation's wide-ranging scientific community, and rapidly boost \"national laboratory testing and strengthen future responses to public-health emergencies.\"  <br><br>But, smothered by bureaucratic inertia and disinterest at the highest levels of the Trump Administration in pandemic preparation, that agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding, today remains far from being fully realized, scientists say. <br><br>\"What we needed was extremely aggressive leadership at the CDC level and at the national level to say, okay, these are all our plans... I don't think there was really a realization of the magnitude of the problem,\" said Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. <br><br>As late as January 28, in an email obtained by CNN, CDC Director Robert Redfield told state public health directors that \"the virus is not spreading in the U.S. at this time and CDC believes the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is low.\" <br><br>But lab directors and epidemiologists said the likely magnitude of the problem was crystal clear to them much earlier. <br><br>\"We certainly said on many conference calls with the CDC during those times that we really needed to expand lab testing,\" in January and early February, said Dr. Jeffrey Engel, a senior adviser on Covid-19 for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists \"Our members were telling the CDC that we needed testing capacity for a public health surveillance because we felt that the virus might be circulating in the US as early as January and we should be testing for that now.\" <br><br>A week before Redfield's email, on January 21, officials in Washington state confirmed that the first case on US soil had been detected there two days earlier.   <br><br>Becker said the intent behind the 2018 coordination plan was \"a good thing\" that did improve communication between the government and commercial labs, but that there was a failure to get those outside the government launched on the testing effort early in process.  <br><br>\"You can add this,\" he said, \"...to the list of things that could have been better in this response.\" <br><br> Reports of an \"unknown pneumonia\"  <br><br>On January 8, Jana Broadhurst was in Kansas City, having a glass of wine and celebrating her second wedding anniversary with her husband, when she got a message from a colleague back in Omaha, Nebraska, about \"news coming out of China.\"  <br><br>Chinese scientists had identified \"unknown pneumonia\" in Wuhan as a novel coronavirus. Within days, Chinese authorities announced the first death in Wuhan from the disease. That weekend, they released the full sequence of the coronavirus genome. <br><br>For Broadhurst, the director of a clinical laboratory at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the message might as well have been an emergency flare. Soon she was on the phone with her colleagues, talking logistics about travel screening and virus detection from her hotel room. Within days, her laboratory would dive into developing its own coronavirus test. <br><br>Her lab gained special permission February 4 to use that test on quarantined passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It would take until February 29, though, for the FDA to give her lab permission to offer tests to residents of Omaha and the surrounding area. <br><br>Hers was not the only lab in that situation. <br><br>\"We had a feeling something was coming, based on what was happening in China,\" said Karen Kaul, chair of pathology at the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois. \"We started looking at developing our own in-house laboratory test in January... We contacted the CDC because CDC had the assay,\" or test. <br><br>Kaul was so anxious to get the test she looked for a way to get her hospital lab certified as a public-health lab, since they would be the first to get the CDC test. But, she said, CDC officials told her \"I could not, because there was no pathway for that to happen\" in the regulations.  <br><br>Then, in early February, a friend forwarded to her a memo from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees clinical laboratories. <br><br>Alphabet soup of overlapping authority <br><br>Three federal agencies -- CMS, the CDC and the FDA -- have overlapping authority over laboratories and lab testing. Before the CDC could distribute its own test to public health labs, for example, it had to get FDA approval for an \"emergency use authorization,\" or EUA, which the FDA issued to the CDC on February 4.  <br><br>The same regulations prevented clinical laboratories from immediately developing and conducting their own tests, said Dr. Jordan Laser, a pathologist for Northwell Health in New York and a member of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee, a committee managed by the CDC that advises on clinical laboratory standards. <br><br>On February 6, CMS sent out a memo to state health officials who survey labs, asking them to notify the agency if they found out about any labs working to conduct a coronavirus test without an emergency use authorization. <br><br>When a friend passed the memo along to her, \"that definitely gave us pause,\" Kaul said. \"No one wants to spend the time and money and manpower developing a test they wouldn't allow you to use... and this shutting down of that avenue severely hampered our ability to test patients.\" <br><br>CMS told CNN that the memo was meant to confirm that \"laboratories are following protocols to ensure accurate testing and patient safety.\" <br><br>For some labs, developing the coronavirus test was the easy part. What was not easy was getting approval from the FDA and the CDC. <br><br>\"Within several weeks of the [DNA] sequence being published, we had what we felt was a reasonably good test for detection of the virus,\" said Morris, at the University of Florida. <br><br>\"The problem was that CDC was insisting on being the sole source for the assay [or test] to be used here in the United States... CDC basically said everything has to come through us.\" <br><br>In a statement to CNN, the FDA said there was nothing wrong in its process.  <br><br>Instead, it blamed individual lab delays \"where labs did not understand the FDA process and mistakenly believed there was more work involved, or just did not even realize that they could develop a test in the first place.\" <br><br> 'Seemed like the right thing to do' <br><br>In Seattle, researchers for the University of Washington-sponsored Seattle Flu Study had taken thousands of swabs from people with flu symptoms across the region. But, during February, federal and state officials repeatedly rejected their requests to let them retest those swabs for coronavirus, as first reported by The New York Times. The CDC said the project's test would need FDA approval; the FDA said the lab would need to be certified first under CMS regulations, which would take months; and the project wasn't certified to share results with state public health officials or anyone else outside the study. <br><br>At the end of February, scientists at the study decided not to wait. They began testing swabs and quickly found another coronavirus case. When they shared that fact with the FDA and the CDC, those agencies initially ordered them to stop testing the swabs.  <br><br>The scientists hurriedly conferred with Karen Moe, the director of the university's institutional research board office, which ensures research meets regulatory and ethical standards. On March 2, she said they had to share the information, regardless.  <br><br>\"Every once in a while, the ethics and the regulations don't match up,\" Moe told CNN. \"Ethically, it sure seemed like the right thing to do.\" <br><br>On February 29, the FDA loosened its regulations, allowing clinical labs to test for coronavirus using tests they developed and validated, so long as they notified the FDA and submitted EUA requests within 15 days.  <br><br>Julie Khani, the president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a partner in the plan, said that it was the FDA's updated guidance at the end of February that was the \"federal call to action for commercial laboratories.\" <br><br>The FDA made further changes March 16, to \"reflect FDA's constant assessment of benefits and risks over the course of the evolving emergency.\" <br><br>Those actions came after weeks of pressure from labs across the country. <br><br>Broader testing, Morris said, \"Should have been an absolute top priority and should have been aggressively pursued by CDC using all avenues possible.\" <br><br>South Korea's success story <br><br>The actions taken in South Korea offers a useful comparison, Morris said. <br><br>Both countries reported their first coronavirus case within a day of one another. Officials in South Korea gave permission just a week later for their commercial labs to develop coronavirus tests. Within two weeks, South Korea was shipping thousands of test kits daily. By mid-March, South Korea was testing at a per-capita rate 40 times higher than the US. <br><br>On March 13, when the total number of US coronavirus tests finally cracked 10,000, South Korea was doing that many tests daily. The results: South Korea was able to \"flatten the curve\" of coronavirus cases by late March, without having to resort to a nationwide shutdown. <br><br>Morris also said the opportunity of having the combined power of many U.S. labs working together was essentially squandered. \"To tackle something like this, you need the big huge commercial machines that are operated by large medical centers, by commercial labs like LabCorp and Quest. You need to get those guys on board.\" <br><br>And that, he said, happened way too late. <br><br>CNN's Robert Kuznia contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "64", "title": "In 1911, another epidemic swept through China.

Speaking to state and local leaders during a phone conversation from the Oval Office later Wednesday, Trump signaled he was working on reopening the economy as \"quickly as possible.\" <br><br>\"We're making tremendous progress. You see that,\" Trump said, according to audio obtained by CNN. \"You see what's going on with the bump, the hill, whatever you want to call it, it's really -- we're looking very good.\" <br><br>Officials said the options being discussed on reopening the country vary widely in scope, from recommendations on benchmarks for when individual states can begin easing restrictions to a nationwide \"big bang\" that Trump previewed Tuesday evening on Fox News. The officials said the conversations were still preliminary and would likely evolve over the course of the next weeks. <br><br>Still, some officials have even begun mulling the type of event Trump may want to mark the day when nationwide restrictions are lifted after he suggested a \"big celebration\" when the crisis is over.  <br><br>The extent to which Trump can declare the country \"reopened\" remains limited. The federal government's guidelines on closing businesses and restricting gatherings were merely recommendations, and decisions on how and when to actually reopen the country will lie mostly with governors who enacted mandatory stay-at-home orders.  <br><br>Americans themselves will also need to feel comfortable returning to crowded restaurants and workplaces before the economy can return to normal. A CNN poll released Wednesday showed 60% of Americans say they would feel uncomfortable returning to their regular routines if social distancing guidelines were lifted after April 30, the current expiration date for Trump's recommendations. <br><br>Yet as data begin to show the severity of the outbreak potentially reaching its peak soon, discussions have accelerated in task force meetings and separate huddles with the President about what a reopening may look like.  <br><br>Trump said Wednesday it will be safe to reopen the country when \"we can say we have to be on that down side of that slope.\" <br><br>\"We can do it in phases, go to some areas where -- you know, some areas are much less affected than others,\" he said. \"But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country.\" <br><br>Trump said he believes the US is \"ahead of schedule\" in efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus: \"You hate to say it too loudly because all of a sudden things don't happen, but I think we will be sooner rather than later.\" <br><br>Multiple officials said this week the discussions could lead to a clash between health and economic advisers, who have disagreed over the past month on the extent and length of distancing recommendations for Americans.  <br><br>On Wednesday morning, one of the President's top media defenders, Fox News host Laura Ingraham, tweeted: \"At some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs. Fauci and Birx and say, we're opening on May 1. Give me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.\" <br><br>Officials also acknowledged that persistent problems in testing Americans and tracing outbreaks could also delay a time when the federal government can recommend states return to normal. <br><br>Increasingly optimistic <br><br>Inside the White House, Trump and his aides have grown increasingly optimistic at the prospect the nation could be turning a corner soon, though health experts warn it's far too early to declare mission accomplished. <br><br>\"Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM, perhaps like never before!!!\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning. <br><br>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert, said discussions on the topic of reopening the country went late into the evening in the White House Roosevelt Room on Tuesday evening. <br><br>\"You don't want to let up at a time that's premature, but right now we are clearly looking at if we, in fact, are as successful as we hope to be over the extended 30 day period that the President announced several days ago -- namely extending the period of restrictions and guidelines to the end of April -- that if, in fact, we are successful, it makes sense to at least plan what a reentry into normality would look like,\" Fauci said in an interview on Fox News.  <br><br>\"That doesn't mean we're going to do it right now,\" Fauci continued, \"but it means we need to be prepared to ease into that.\" <br><br>The White House coronavirus task force has been grappling with questions over what the \"reopening\" of the economy looks like. There are some who believe that it can be a nationwide event versus others -- including medical experts -- who say a staggered or \"uneven\" reopening by region or industry seems more prudent. <br><br>Preliminary planning has focused on how to geographically distinguish places that could reopen sooner, with the expectation that hard-hit areas like New York won't open any time soon. <br><br>Weighing benchmarks <br><br>The task force has weighed benchmarks that might indicate a state is ready to loosen restrictions on businesses and gatherings, including a sustained 14-day period reduction in the number of confirmed cases, normal operations returned to hospitals and widely available testing.  <br><br>As an example of some of the questions being thrown around the task force meetings, according to a source: \"Do you reopen restaurants but force bars to close on Friday nights so that they're not packed with people?\" <br><br>Officials have also weighed recommending certain spacing of tables in restaurants or limits on the number of people allowed to be inside any particularly establishment at one time. <br><br>Some of Trump's advisers believe rural or smaller towns are on track for reopening in a quicker time frame and want to focus on how to best identify those areas. But others on the team, and Trump himself, seem to be eyeing a more widespread announcement.  <br><br>\"We're looking at the concept where we open sections of the country and we're also looking at the concept where you open up everything,\" the President said, speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity Tuesday night.  <br><br>\"I'd love to open with a big bang, one beautiful country, and just open,\" he said. \"It's very possible.\" <br><br>A central hurdle for the administration remains the availability of widespread testing, which Trump's health experts acknowledge is still an issue. Many inside the White House fear the ongoing struggle to ramp up testing could impede any reopening efforts. <br><br>While testing has increased rapidly since the fraught early days of the outbreak, many states have still only tested small percentages of their populations. <br><br>The White House has worked to develop a more robust testing strategy, including shipping new rapid tests developed by Abbott Laboratories to states. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, pleaded with state health officials during a briefing on Tuesday to get their Abbott testing devices online. <br><br>The White House has also worked to scale up serology testing, used to detect antibodies that would identify people who are likely immune to coronavirus and who could return to work or other aspects of normal life. <br><br>\"This will be able to tell you, have you had it, are you likely immune to it, and are you really likely very safe to go back to work and not risk exposing other people,\" said Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, in an interview on Fox Business. Giroir has been tasked with leading testing efforts. \"You're going to see these tests mix over the next month, but we're still going to be actively surveilling for people who may have the active virus.\" <br><br>CNN's Jim Acosta and Vivian Salama contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "230", "title": "House approves $480 billion package to help small businesses and hospitals, expand Covid-19 testing"}, {"id": "56", "title": "This is where all 50 states stand on reopening"}, {"id": "198", "title": "As Poland defies 'European values,' women resist on streets and online"}, {"id": "139", "title": "Is an 'immunity certificate' the way to get out of coronavirus lockdown?"}]}, "120": {"title": "The world is coming together to fight coronavirus.

But despite numerous international agreements, governments have been slow to take action to reduce carbon emissions. <br><br>\"It actually hurts because it shows that at the national, or international level, if we need to take action we can. So why haven't we for climate? And not with words, with real actions,\" said Donna Green, associate professor at University of New South Wales's Climate Change Research Centre.  <br><br>Heat-trapping emissions from human activity keep rising, air pollution continues to choke cities, and the world is on track to warm by 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.   <br><br>So why haven't governments done more to protect their citizens from the impact of climate change? <br><br>Climate change is a global health crisis <br><br>The climate crisis is also a global health emergency.  <br><br>Air pollution kills 7 million people every year, according to the World Health Organization. A recent study found toxic air shortens lives worldwide by nearly three years on average. And the life of every child born today will be profoundly affected by climate change, according to another report.  <br><br>The novel coronavirus, discovered in China in mid-December, has so far killed more than 24,000 people, and infected more than 550,000 in 176 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the WHO and additional sources. <br><br>The impact of the virus has been sudden and dramatic.  <br><br>The toll of climate change is slow and steady -- but no less deadly.  <br><br>Part of the difference in the response to the two crises is that, for many people, the virus is more of an immediate, tangible threat. The virus is infecting people now and is the undisputed source of their illness. <br><br>\"You can put a virus particle down a microscope and draw a picture of it, it looks scary. You can explain how in medical science, you can deal with that particular virus, develop a vaccine and take steps to respond,\" said Green. <br><br>Climate crisis is not a virus. The illnesses it causes and dangers it poses come through a third party -- pollution, a flood, a drought -- giving climate crisis deniers an opportunity to argue they were caused by other factors. <br><br>And for many people not on the front lines, climate crisis feels like a future problem.  <br><br>\"In terms of their lives, and this being an existential crisis, and a threat, I don't think that comes off as immediately as something like a pandemic,\" said Miro Korenha, co-founder of Our Daily Planet, a Washington DC-based environmental news platform. \"They hear climate change is something that might be off in the future, maybe it won't hit their community.\" <br><br>Acting quickly <br><br>Countries that enacted early detection measures for the coronavirus, quickly allocated medical resources and issued social distancing measures, have fared better than countries that were slower to respond.  <br><br>South Korea, for example, has one of the worst outbreaks outside of China but it moved fast to conduct widespread testing, and in recent weeks its caseloads have stabilized.  <br><br>There are concerns that other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, have been slow to act. A recent study by UK epidemiologists predicts that attempts to slow -- rather than actively halt, or suppress -- the novel coronavirus could overwhelm the number of intensive care hospital beds available and lead to about 250,000 deaths in the UK and more than one million in the US.  <br><br>That lesson of preparedness applies to the climate crisis. <br><br>Countries need to act quickly to mitigate against future worst-case climate scenarios, rather than waiting for the disaster to peak before acting. <br><br>They can do this by reducing emissions, developing green technology and implementing effective climate policies.  <br><br>We know what must be done -- both to stop the spread of coronavirus and to fight climate change -- but many countries that produce the most heat-trapping gases are waiting until it is too late. <br><br>Just as in some places, people have been slow to adopt the social distancing doctors are advising to fight the spread of the virus, not enough countries, especially those that produce the most heat-trapping gases, are taking significant action to slash emissions. <br><br>We have the tools <br><br>One of the unintended consequences of the drastic measures enforced by China during the coronavirus outbreak was a sharp drop in emissions. <br><br>China's air pollutant levels fell by about 20-30% in February as a result of the restrictions on industry and traffic, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. <br><br>Italy, which has the largest outbreak outside of China and has enacted widespread shutdowns, has also seen a big decline in air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions, according to the European Space Agency.  <br><br>Travel bans have grounded flights and removed the ability to travel -- a big contributor to heat-trapping emissions. And working from home experiments are showing that not everyone needs to travel to the office.  <br><br>Most agree, however, that suddenly closing all factories and banning cars from roads is not a sustainable way to tackle climate change. Governments have expressed concerns about the impact of closures and restrictions of movement on their economies, and on Tuesday, credit-rating agency S&P Global said that the virus has plunged the world into a global recession.  <br><br>But climate scientists say that adapting to climate change does not require radical shutdowns -- the technology needed to reduce emissions already exists. Renewable energy sources are a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels, and making the switch makes economic sense.   <br><br>\"It's absolutely possible to completely transform our country and world economies in a way that's sustainable, in a way that would mitigate the risk,\" Green said.  <br><br>Getting political  <br><br>So if we have the tools, what's stopping action? <br><br>Scientists say politics plays a bit part in decision making. <br><br>Since President Donald Trump came to power in 2016, for example, his administration has halted climate regulations designed to limit global warming. He's promised to leave the landmark Paris climate accord, relaxed restrictions on power plant emissions, weakened fuel economy standards for the auto industry, and opened large swaths of protected land up for mining and oil and gas development. <br><br>His administration has scrubbed references to climate change, renewable energy and similar topics on websites across the federal government. There is also a powerful fossil fuel lobby in the US. <br><br>This ignorance or denial of the science is hampering the response to both the climate crisis and coronavirus. <br><br>In the US, Trump and officials in his administration have been at odds with what health experts are saying about the virus. Trump claimed the coronavirus death rate is lower than 3.4% based on a \"hunch,\" undermining the World Health Organization's figures. He said that the number of coronavirus cases in the US would \"going very substantially down, not up,\" when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said to expect more cases. And the President was contradicted by a health expert when he said a vaccine would be ready within a few months -- in reality, a vaccine could take a year or longer to develop.  <br><br>\"If the President can say something that's contrary to what the government's top scientists are saying, that's a really difficult and dangerous predicament,\" said Our Daily Planet's Korenha. \"The real danger here is that people stop trusting information [from] government scientists.\" <br><br>The need for government transparency and readily available public information is vital in stopping the coronavirus from overrunning countries. <br><br>The media also plays a big part in making sure the public gets the information it needs in a way that's easy to understand.  <br><br>The coronavirus pandemic has taken over the 24-hour news cycle, with broadcast media running almost non-stop coverage in many countries. Viewers and readers are hungry for up-to-date coronavirus information to make informed decisions about their lives.  <br><br>The demand for climate change information, however, hasn't been as urgent and big climate headlines have not garnered similar rolling coverage. A study by Media Matters found that the major US broadcast networks aired just 238 minutes of climate coverage last year, making up only 0.7% of overall output. <br><br>\"If climate even got one tenth of (coronavirus) coverage, how that might change public perception, how people might realize that this is a threat to them?\" Korenha said.  <br><br>Pivoting to the future <br><br>Coronavirus has been a stress test for countries around the world, that has put devastating strains on economies and health systems.  <br><br>Airlines are losing billions of dollars, thousands could lose their jobs, a global recession is around the corner and social isolation is upending daily life.  <br><br>But this won't last forever. The emergency measures are short term -- until outbreaks are managed or a vaccine is developed.   <br><br>The fight against the climate crisis is a long-term problem that requires completely rethinking many of our industries and ways of life. But the not responding will lead to a far worse alternative. <br><br>Climate crisis will seriously disrupt economies, reduce food security and place greater strain on health services, as a warmer world means more disease, famine, deaths from natural disasters and pollution, as well as mental health problems. <br><br>Coronavirus has shown that in order to avert the worst impacts of a global crisis, world leaders need to come together to make bold change. That means enacting policies, investing in innovative green technology, switching to clean energy and getting the public to change their daily habits.   <br><br>The world has been given a trial run in global crisis management. It shouldn't waste it. <br><br>CNN's Drew Kann contributed.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "199", "title": "For China's aggressive new diplomacy, coronavirus is both a crisis and an opportunity"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "107", "title": "Fauci says coronavirus hospitalizations are dropping because social distancing is working "}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

That's because humans have farmed them for food and lived with or near them for centuries. <br><br>Humans also share more than 98% of DNA with chimpanzees and mice. This makes the animals more susceptible to many of the same health problems as humans -- hence their use in many lab studies, according to the California Biomedical Research Association (PDF). <br><br>Bats and primates are \"disproportionately likely sources of viral spillover to humans\" due to their biological similarity and unique metabolic regulation of immune responses to infection, said Thomas Gillespie, a disease ecologist from Emory University. Gillespie was not involved in the study. <br><br>Stress caused by humans <br><br>The human-caused stress that mammals face also increases the risk of zoonotic spillover.  <br><br>When we capture wild animals from their natural homes to put them into trade and sell them in animal markets, they undergo a great deal of tension, Johnson said.  <br><br>\"And when that happens, they're more likely to produce high numbers of viruses that they might be infected with,\" she added.  <br><br>Higher numbers of viruses mean greater viral shedding, which is the expulsion and release of excretions infected with the virus. So being around captured, stressed animals exposes people to higher virual loads and a greater chance of catching the virus than if we were to have contact with them in the wild, Johnson said. <br><br>Shifts in mammalian populations <br><br>The researchers studied zoonotic viruses and their land-based mammalian hosts, using 2004 to 2013 data from an internationally recognized authority on threatened species.  <br><br>Among the 142 zoonotic viruses examined, 139 viruses had at least one mammalian host reported at the species level.  <br><br>Domesticated mammals -- including cats and dogs, pigs and cattle, horses and sheep-- host 50% of the viruses that can be passed to mankind, despite representing only 12 species, according to the report. Rodents, bats and primates also carried high proportions of zoonotic diseases. <br><br>There are a couple of reasons why some species have lower or higher risk for zoonotic viruses, Johnson said.  <br><br>Wild mammals with threatened conservation status are rare, so the probability of those animals encountering humans is low. They also may harbor fewer parasites since their populations are smaller.  <br><br>Threatened species with a reduction in population size due to human exploitation -- by hunting, trade and human occupation -- have over twice as many zoonotic viruses compared to those threatened for other reasons.  <br><br>\"Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and the wild animal trade may have increased opportunities for virus spillover because of the close contact between wildlife and humans involved in these activities,\" the report said.   <br><br>\"The lack of awareness in the society for climate change and the role of wildlife has multiplied this problem to many folds. The wildlife is at run due to lack of habitat and food, leading to an increase in human exposure to wild animals,\" said Dr. Suresh Mittal, professor of virology at Purdue University, who was also not involved with the study.  <br><br>The lack of available data on the presence or absence of zoonotic viruses for nearly 90% of wild mammal species \"creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the results,\" Gillespie said.  <br><br>Further studies that observe both animal and human pathogens along with information on natural and human systems are needed, he added.    <br><br>Histories of zoonotic diseases <br><br>There are several examples of virus spillover from animals to humans, including the Nipah virus from fruit bats and the AIDS crisis from the butchering of chimpanzees. There's also SARS, from horseshoe bats in the early 2000s, and Herpes B virus, carried by macaque monkeys.  <br><br>And of course, the latest is the novel coronavirus, potentially either from bats or an unknown spark that could have been circulating at low levels in humans for years before becoming seriously infectious.  <br><br>However, zoonotic diseases don't always manifest as outbreaks. Some infections lie low and go undetected, while others have and can become much more serious.  <br><br>The gravity of the outcome depends on the characteristics of the virus, including whether it's able to jump from an animal into a human host then move to another human, its infection rate and the severity of symptoms.  <br><br>\"Rabies is a good example, right?\" Johnson said. \"Rabies is very common around the world, but there are viruses like rabies that just jump into humans and then they stutter out. They only affect the human that the animal basically was in contact with, so they're limited.\"  <br><br>That's happened with some previous strains of coronavirus, Johnson said. Some have spilled over into humans before, but may have resulted in only mild, sometimes seasonal, disease.  <br><br>Implications for the future  <br><br>The decline of species is a health problem that occurs for various reasons, Johnson said. But the declines as underlying causes of virus spillovers urge us to \"think about environmental change and the impact that has on wild animal species.\"  <br><br>\"We need to start to think about environmental health together with our health,\" she added. \"Realizing that, we've seen with this pandemic, if our activities with wildlife are not thoughtful and we're not minimizing contact with wildlife, that we are at risk and this disease emergence event is unprecedented in its impact.\"  <br><br>\"Far too often, commercial activities that require large-scale land use change levy tremendous costs that are not considered in cost-benefit analysis because the costs are not shouldered by those profiting,\" Gillespie said. <br><br>\"Three months ago, pandemics did not feel like an urgent issue, people did not feel vulnerable. Now the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting people -- it's affecting the stock market, their quality of life, their health and their loved ones,\" he added.  <br><br>\"Now this feels urgent, now they feel vulnerable. It's in moments like this that real change can happen. The key is ensuring that this crisis catalyzes societal and environmental solutions instead of reinforcing entrenched irrationality.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "161", "title": "What is coronavirus and Covid-19?

But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual. <br><br>Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <br><br>Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family. <br><br>1. Shortness of breath <br><br>Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.  <br><br>\"If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department,\" said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris. <br><br>\"If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911,\" Harris added. <br><br>The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a \"persistent pain or pressure in the chest,\" and \"bluish lips or face,\" which can indicate a lack of oxygen. <br><br>Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. <br><br>2. Fever <br><br>Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number. <br><br>CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.  <br><br>\"I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm,\" Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall. <br><br>Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius). <br><br>\"There are many misconceptions about fever,\" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. <br><br>\"We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree,\" Williams said, adding that for most people \"99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever.\"   <br><br>Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening. <br><br>\"Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal,\" Schaffner explained. <br><br>\"One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever.\" <br><br>3. Dry Cough <br><br>Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough. <br><br>\"It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated,\" Schaffner explained. <br><br>The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest. <br><br>\"It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated,\" Schaffner added. <br><br>A report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.  <br><br>4. Chills and body aches <br><br>\"The beast comes out at night,\" said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.  <br><br>'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ...  I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors,\" he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family. <br><br>\"I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky,\" Cuomo said.  <br><br>Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame. <br><br>One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen. <br><br>5. Sudden confusion <br><br>Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain,  the CDC says to seek help immediately. <br><br>6. Digestive issues <br><br>At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.  <br><br>\"In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients,\" Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program. <br><br>Overall, \"I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have,\" Gupta said. <br><br>The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems. <br><br>7. Pink eye <br><br>Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.  <br><br>Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid. <br><br>But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same. <br><br>Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. <br><br>8. Loss of smell and taste <br><br>In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19. <br><br>\"What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day. <br><br>\"It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for,\" Gupta said. \"Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones.\" <br><br>\"Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms,\" according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. <br><br>A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia. <br><br>It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to ENT UK (PDF), a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom. <br><br>Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the \"jellybean test\" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine. <br><br>9. Fatigue <br><br>For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue. <br><br>Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.  <br><br>\"I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by,\" Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. \"I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours.\" <br><br>Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks. <br><br>10. Headache, sore throat, congestion <br><br>The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.  <br><br>Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion. <br><br>Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.  <br><br>So what should you do? <br><br>\"At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them\" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris. <br><br>That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC. <br><br>It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections. <br><br>In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder. <br><br>\"Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,\" the CDC advises. <br><br>To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues. <br><br>\"People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age,\" Schaffner said. <br><br>A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not. <br><br>How to be evaluated <br><br>If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say. <br><br>\"We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue,\" Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. \"However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated.\" <br><br>If you do have those three signs, where should you go? <br><br>\"If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients,\" Harris said. <br><br>\"If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers,\" Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call. <br><br>\"If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly,\" Schaffer said. \"It's always good to notify them that you're coming.

Here's why it may be dangerous to conceive in quarantine.", "content": "As much of the world settles into a new routine of social distancing, couples are likely to have a lot more free time at home together. <br><br>At first blush, you'd think couples with some extra time on their hands would do things that could lead to a stork visiting nine months from now. <br><br>Yet with US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warning of dire scenarios and a possible 20% unemployment rate, couples whose jobs are vulnerable in this economy are likely to think again about kicking off their parenting journeys this spring. <br><br>Then there's the possibility of more couples splitting up. One marriage registry official in China said he saw a quarantine-related spike in divorces, showing that more time in closed quarters may be doing some couples more harm than good. <br><br>But for couples weathering this storm together, is this a time when many will choose to add to their brood? <br><br>Baby booms can follow smaller storms <br><br>\"I don't foresee a baby boom in nine months,\" Dr. Renee Wellenstein, an OB/GYN and functional medicine specialist in upstate New York, told CNN. <br><br>In a less severe context, like a snowstorm, sure -- it's quite common to see an uptick in births nine months later. <br><br>She noted that couples spend more time cozying up indoors during the late fall and winter. Consequently, \"in the northeast we see more babies in the late summer and fall months,\" she said. <br><br>Studies back up her clinical observations. <br><br>A 2007 paper by scientists at the University of Texas and Johns Hopkins University argued that relatively minor storm advisory events that caused power outages had slight positive effects in boosting the birth rate. However, the \"highest-severity\" storms causing death and destruction had a demonstrable negative impact, reducing the birth rate. <br><br>But larger disasters can lower birth rates <br><br>\"Illness, quarantine and death can all have a major impact on conception, pregnancy and birth,\" scholar Lyman Stone wrote in an article published in March by the Institute for Family Studies. <br><br>\"Previous academic literature has shown that high-mortality events as diverse as famines, earthquakes, heatwaves and disease all have very predictable effects on reducing births nine months later,\" he said. <br><br>Stone looked at birth trends following recent catastrophes, including Hurricanes Maria and Katrina in the US as well as the 2015 Ebola outbreaks in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Those all led to marked declines in birth rates. <br><br>One major progression leaps out: \"Events that cause a large increase in deaths tend to cause a large decrease in births nine months later,\" Stone writes. <br><br>On the flip side, events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Oklahoma City bombing may have led to higher birth rates, due in part to their effect on the American psyche, causing couples to cling more closely together. <br><br>It may be hard to get pregnant right now <br><br>First and foremost, Wellenstein said that when and how to get pregnant is a personal decision. Anyone thinking about getting pregnant should consult their doctor because there are so many individual circumstances in which couples are not in control of their time of conception. <br><br>Women in their late 30s, couples experiencing infertility, and those who are already pregnant will have to make judicious decisions to achieve their dreams of building a family during this crucial time when the pandemic isn't under control. <br><br>But for couples who think they can choose to get pregnant, Wellenstein said she would \"absolutely not\" advise anyone to try in the immediate future, due to the uncertainty swirling around Covid-19.   <br><br>And although being snowed in can be a little fun and lead to romance, the pandemic is stressful for couples: \"[The] libido is down and menstrual cycles may be off,\" Wellenstein said. \"It may not be possible to conceive due to this.\" <br><br>There are a number of risk factors, starting with the fact that there's simply less care available in many areas as hospitals prioritize more resources toward helping the surge of Covid-19 patients being admitted. <br><br>And for women who are already pregnant, each trip to the hospital during the pandemic carries additional risk. <br><br>\"It's never ideal to have any infectious disease during the pregnancy due to the unknown impact on the child,\" Wellenstein said. \"To enter a hospital puts her at risk.\" <br><br>Regardless of where the science ultimately lands on transmission of the novel coronavirus in the placenta, it's a risk not worth taking, Wellenstein says. Once the baby is born, we know with certainty that she is at risk from any virus carriers she may come in contact with.  <br><br>There's a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus <br><br>While we don't know with certainty yet, preliminary studies available so far appear to argue against coronavirus being transmitted during pregnancy.  <br><br>A study recently published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics focused on 33 pregnant women who were infected with coronavirus. It showed that in the first week of their lives, just three of the newborns tested positive. <br><br>But experts believe the babies contracted the virus once they were out in the world -- and not while in their mothers' wombs. <br><br>\"As all infants had amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood tested for Covid-19 with negative results, this is evidence against the virus being transmitted from mother to fetus via the placenta,\" Dr. Andrew Whitelaw, emeritus professor of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol, told the Science Media Centre in the UK. <br><br>Nevertheless, doctors have concern about whether a mother could expose her child to the virus after birth. <br><br>Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that she was fearful of being infected during a critical time in her life -- and her baby's.  <br><br>\"I am almost 39 weeks pregnant as of the time that we are speaking,\" she said. \"I mean, I have a recurring nightmare myself of contracting Covid-19, and going through childbirth where I have to wear a mask.\" <br><br>\"And if my newborn were to get ill,\" Wen continued, \"she would become extremely ill because she doesn't have immunity and little babies are so fragile. And I know of so many other pregnant women who have their own anxieties in this time. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory virus, if the mom were to cough and then she coughed onto her hand and then her hand touched the baby, she could infect her newborn that way.\" <br><br>The CDC's recommendations include having safeguards to separate the mom and the newborn. <br><br>Wait until things return to normal <br><br>It's still too soon to make any substantive birth rate forecasts. We don't know how long this year's pandemic will remain vicious, what the long-term effects on young people are, or how far and wide a deepening global economic recession might reach. <br><br>History does have examples of a surging birth rate after tragedy: The historic Baby Boom generation is composed of those born in America's post-World War II years between 1946 and 1964. <br><br>Scholars point to many causes, but generally agree that following the tumult of the Great Depression and World War II, couples found it more realistic to raise children in the relative calm and economic prosperity following the war. <br><br>The birth rate ebbs and flows. And with any coronavirus-related baby boom, it could manifest once things feel safe again. <br><br>Though Stone says the coronavirus could lead to a short-term slump, his analysis shows that birth rates could rebound again over the next one to five years. <br><br>\"A couple months after this situation resolves you might start to see more pregnancies,\" Wellenstein said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "146", "title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

On Sunday, Trump muzzled the country's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci before he could contradict his own gushing assessment of an unproven Covid-19 therapy. On Monday, the President also blasted a report by an experienced Health and Human Services Department watchdog official that found critical supply shortages at hospitals all over the country, claiming it was politically motivated. <br><br>Tensions between science and politics that lie at the core of the battle to eradicate the pandemic while still saving the economy will become even more acute as pressure grows inside the administration to reopen normal life. <br><br>Over the weekend, one of Trump's economic advisers -- Peter Navarro -- clashed with Fauci over the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, the drug the President insists could save Covid-19 patients, according to people familiar with the disagreement. <br><br>Navarro told CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday that despite his lack of a medical education, he was competent to weigh in on the issue. <br><br>\"My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I'm a social scientist,\" Navarro said. In remarks that epitomized the administration's lax respect for expertise. \"I have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\" <br><br>When reporters tried to ask Fauci, who has previously expressed caution about the drug, about its uses at a briefing on Sunday, the President would not allow him to answer, saying he had tackled the question himself many times. <br><br>In one vital area of the pandemic response, Trump is still listening to the experts. He is sticking to advice given by Fauci and another top coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx to extend social distancing guidelines until April 30. The doctors last week presented dire warnings of several million deaths if he did not act. <br><br>But his feuds with reporters on other issues Monday underscored his wider reluctance to allow inconvenient evidence to mar his cultivated picture of hugely successful leadership amid the worst domestic crisis since World War II. <br><br>\"We are the federal government. We are not supposed to stand on street corners during testing,\" he said, when confronted with questions about deficiencies in coronavirus testing. <br><br>On the day when the US death toll passed 10,000 there was something surreal in watching the President's outbursts, a familiar tactic that often pleases his political base and serves to portray himself as a victim of what he claims is a biased media. <br><br>Trump disrupts science <br><br>  <br><br>The willingness of a President -- who once predicted a \"miracle\" would sweep the virus away -- to disregard expert advice has colored his entire administration, from climate change to foreign policy and the current crisis. The political model that made him so attractive to Americans dismayed with the elite expert establishment is based on disruption -- and when the facts get in the way they become superfluous. <br><br>Suspicion of science and government expertise run deep in the core of the Trump team's DNA. Hundreds of bureaucrats have left the government as Trump has blasted a \"deep state\" of public officials. One of his ex-senior advisers, Steve Bannon, once described Trump's mission as the \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" <br><br>The President also installed loyalists in positions for which they appear unqualified but advance his priorities. A widely panned briefing last week by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, now dabbling in the pandemic response, was a case-in-point. <br><br>But the pandemic has shown that a \"deep state\" of scientists is vital to the public good during a public health threat. One reason why Trump appeared to be flailing in recent news conferences may be that his political approach -- based on denying robust fact-based evidence -- is being badly exposed. <br><br>Trump offers therapy to sick British PM <br><br>  <br><br>In one of the strangest moments of Monday's appearance in the White House Briefing Room, Trump seemed to suggest he had rushed an unspecified mystery therapy to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is battling Covid-19 in intensive care. <br><br>After meeting the heads of pharmaceutical companies, Trump said: \"I've asked them to contact London immediately.\" <br><br>\"They speak a language that most people don't even understand, but I understand something, that they've really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically, and they have arrived in London already,\" Trump said. \"We've contacted all of Boris' doctors, and we'll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.\" <br><br>It was not clear which therapy Trump was referencing. And his offer would apparently involve the British Prime Minister's doctors handing over treatment decisions to American pharmaceutical companies. But in recent days he's been aggressively touting the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and dispensing medical advice that it should be given to coronavirus victims. <br><br>US government medical experts say the therapy may have some promise but say there is little solid scientific evidence that the treatment, a favorite of conservative media commentators who have Trump's ear, is effective in treating the disease. <br><br>\"There are some very strong, powerful signs\" that the drug is effective in dispelling the virus from patients bodies, Trump said Sunday. <br><br>Physicians however warn that hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side-effects and should not be prescribed without robust testing regimens. <br><br>Addressing Trump's question \"What do you have to lose?\" Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine specialist in New York, told CNN, \"maybe your vision, maybe the normal electrical activity of your heart, maybe your life.\" <br><br>Spencer said everyone hoped that hydroxychloroquine could be a \"miracle drug\" but warned against peddling \"magic bullet\" treatments. Trump's desperation to find a cure that could save lives and reopen an economy that has shed millions of jobs does him credit, and it is important for a President to use his power to push the envelope to spark breakthroughs. <br><br>But his willingness to bypass science to fulfill his preferred reality would turn the principles of modern medicine on their head. It also implies a misunderstanding of the basic moral creed ingrained in the medical profession. It's not yet clear whether hydroxychloroquine has the potential to make people better significantly outweighs the risk of doing them harm. <br><br>Trump's keenness to start prescribing the drug in large quantities to Covid-19 patients mirrors his attitude to science in other areas. For instance, the science of climate change is inconvenient to his plans to boost the carbon economy and to shield Americans from the economic consequences of cutting emissions that harm the planet. <br><br>Sometimes, the President offers an ironic glimpse of clarity when he's discussing such matters. <br><br>\"What do I know, I'm not a doctor,\" he said on Sunday. <br><br>Trump attacks author of critical report <br><br>  <br><br>The President also took unkindly to a Department of Health and Human Services inspector general's report published Monday that found \"severe\" and \"widespread\" shortages of medical supplies, hampering the ability to test suspected coronavirus patients and to respond to the pandemic adequately and protect medical staff. <br><br>The assessment, the first internal government look at the response, was based on interviews from March 23-27 with administrators from more than 300 hospitals across 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. <br><br>It challenges Trump's claim that the federal government's response to the pandemic has been perfect, and reinforces complaints by medical staff and state governors and city mayors who warn of a dire front line situation. <br><br>The report was written by the principal deputy inspector general for the department, Christi Grimm. According to her official biography, Grimm, who has worked for multiple administrations, is an award-winning public servant with \"two decades of leadership and expertise in health and human services programs.\" <br><br>But Trump immediately denigrated her professional and personal credentials and suggested she was motivated by a partisan desire to harm his administration. <br><br>\"Give me the name of the inspector general. Could politics be entered into that?\" Trump said, indulging another troubling trait, the singling out of public officials that he deems insufficiently loyal to him personally. <br><br>Trump's fury erupted just three days after he fired another inspector general -- Michael Atkinson, who serves the intelligence community -- who was responsible for informing Congress of the whistleblower report that led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "144", "title": "How Fauci and Birx got Trump to listen to science"}]}, "135": {"title": "How did coronavirus break out? Theories abound as researchers race to solve genetic detective story", "content": "A vacuum of knowledge about the origins of the new coronavirus ravaging the world has provided fertile ground for all manner of theories -- from the fantastic, to the dubious to the believable. <br><br>It was a bioweapon manufactured by the Chinese. The US Army brought the virus to Wuhan. It leaked -- like a genie out of a bottle -- from a lab in an accident. It took root at a wildlife market in Wuhan. <br><br>Scientists have banded together across international borders to condemn the nationalist-tinged conspiracy theories. And yet, they are divided on what was once widely thought the most likely culprit: a so-called wet market in Wuhan, where wild animals are kept in cages and sold as pets or food. It is believed that a bat-infected animal -- perhaps a pangolin -- infected the first human.  <br><br>The truth of how this began remains elusive. But CNN spoke to more than half a dozen virus experts about the origins of the outbreak, and all of them say anyone who claims to know the source of Covid-19 is guessing. The scientists say there is zero evidence the Chinese or American government purposefully introduced the new coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- to the public. <br><br>To date, one thing seems likely: It came from bats. <br><br>Experts at odds over wet-market theory <br><br>It's \"the most simple, obvious and likely explanation,\" said Dr. Simon Anthony, a professor at the public health grad school of Columbia University and a key member of PREDICT, a federally funded global program investigating viruses in animal hosts with pandemic potential. PREDICT has discovered 180 coronaviruses over a decade. <br><br>Though the scientists discount conspiracy theories about bioweapons, on other questions they are divided. <br><br>The experts are at odds over the once widely accepted theory that the virus originated at a wet market. <br><br>Proponents believe the gory nature of these crowded markets packed with people and wild animals slated for slaughter make them the most likely culprit; the doubters cite a peer-reviewed study indicating that many of the first known patients had no direct exposure to the so-called wet market.  <br><br>Another potentially explosive theory -- first posed by two Chinese researchers in early February and amplified by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on March 31 -- holds that the origin traces back to an accident in one of two labs near the Wuhan market that work with bats. <br><br>Most of the experts interviewed for this story discounted the theory -- whose progenitors reportedly withdrew their paper -- saying it wasn't supported by evidence.   <br><br>The theory has also been strenuously denied by the Chinese government and one of the labs. <br><br>But one expert, a chemical biology professor and bioweapons expert at Rutgers University, has suggested to several media outlets that the lab-accident theory has credence. <br><br>\"The possibility that the virus entered humans through a laboratory accident cannot and should not be dismissed,\" Dr. Richard Ebright told CNN in an email Sunday.  <br><br>Virus hunters zeroing in on bats <br><br>In any case, researchers agree that the coronavirus jumped from an animal to a human, a phenomenon known as \"zoonotic spillover.\" <br><br>In early February, Chinese researchers published an article in Nature -- a top science journal -- that concluded the \"2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\" <br><br>Later that month, 27 public health scientists from across the United States and the world wrote a letter in The Lancet condemning the conspiracy theories. <br><br>\"Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus,\" they wrote. <br><br>In the Lancet piece, the experts cited scientific evidence that support the theory that \"overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.\" <br><br>One of those scientists is Peter Daszak, a preeminent virus hunter who has been working in China for 10 years. <br><br>\"We're very confident that the origin of Covid-19 is in bats,\" said Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a health nonprofit that tracks zoonotic spillover. \"We just don't know where exactly it originated -- which bat species exactly. And we don't know how many others there are out there that could emerge in the future.\" <br><br>It is a genetic detective story. <br><br>Did it jump from bat to human, or to another animal first? <br><br>Researchers hope to trace the virus that is killing tens of thousands to a yet-to-be captured bat in the wild. <br><br>Another source of debate is whether the virus that causes Covid-19 transferred directly from bat to human, or whether there was an \"intermediate\" animal between. <br><br>Daszak believes a bat infected a farm animal that was brought to market alive, and kept with people in one of the most perfect incubators for viral infection: the Chinese wet market. <br><br>\"The first time you go into China as a Westerner, it is a bit of shock to go to a wildlife market and see this huge diversity of animals live in cages on top of each other with a pile of guts that have been pulled out of an animal and thrown on the floor,\" he said. \"As you walk towards the stalls, you slip on the feces and blood. These are perfect places for viruses to spread. Not only that, people are working there ... kids are playing there. Families almost live there.\"  <br><br>Professor Andrew Cunningham of the Zoological Society of London says wet markets are a prime candidate for causing zoonotic spillover events from wildlife, which he said have become more common over the past 30 years. <br><br>\"If you bring wild animals -- you catch them in the wild, you bring them together in large numbers,\" he said. \"They're stressed and then they can become virus factories, and they're in close contact with human beings in the markets and they're butchered in the markets, and by people in relatively unhygienic conditions.\" <br><br>But an article in Lancet has cast some doubt on the theory. The study shows that about a third of the first 41 confirmed infected patients had no direct exposure to the wet market. Among them was the first known patient, whose symptoms reportedly began appearing December 1. <br><br>\"No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,\" the report states. <br><br>The market was shuttered January 1, two days after the Wuhan authorities issued a public health alert about it. <br><br>(An article in the South China Morning Post puts the date of the first case as early as November 17.) <br><br>\"I think people went into the fish market who were already infected,\" Vincent Racaniello, a microbiology professor at Columbia University, told CNN. <br><br>Most experts push back on lab leak theory <br><br>Racaniello offers yet another theory: The source of the outbreak is a farmer. <br><br>\"In bats, these viruses are intestinal viruses, and they are shedding the bat feces, which we call guano,\" he said. \"And if you go into a bat cave, it is littered with guano. And farmers in many countries harvest the guano to fertilize their fields.\" <br><br>Racaniello speculates that, after getting infected, a farmer or an associate came into Wuhan and started infecting other people. <br><br>\"We do know that in China you can eat bats -- that's another scenario,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's any more likely than a farmer harvesting guano or a farmer encountering a bat in his barn.\"  <br><br>Anthony, also of Columbia, echoed Racaniello's skepticism of the wet-market theory. <br><br>\"Early in the outbreak ... everyone was talking about the thing having emerged from the wet market,\" he said. \"And now I think the data calls into question whether or not that's really true.\" <br><br>Anthony noted that not even the mystery of the 2003 SARS outbreak is settled. <br><br>For many years, it was widely believed that the SARS virus jumped from a bat to an intermediate host -- a cat-like civet -- that infected a person at a food market in China. But a study in 2013 -- backed by a followup in 2017 -- suggested that the 2003 coronavirus could also have jumped straight from a bat into a human. <br><br>\"We don't know which of those is actually true,\" Anthony said. <br><br>Perhaps, the most forceful rejection of the wet-market theory came from Ebright of Rutgers. <br><br>\"It is absolutely clear the market had no connection with the origin of the outbreak virus, and, instead, only was involved in amplification of an outbreak that had started elsewhere in Wuhan almost a full month earlier,\" he told CNN.  <br><br>Ebright also isn't ready to rule out the theory of the two Chinese researchers that the virus may have \"leaked\" from one of two labs near the Wuhan market, although one of the authors told The Wall Street Journal they withdrew the paper because it \"was not supported by direct proofs.\"  <br><br>While Ebright said he did not believe the genome sequence of the virus shows any \"signatures of human manipulation,\" he said there is a risk that a lab worker could have accidentally been infected. <br><br>CNN was not able to independently verify the points made by Ebright, and the main author of the study -- Botao Xiao -- did not respond to CNN's emails and phone calls requesting comment.  <br><br>US-China tensions slowing down the virus hunters <br><br>But one of the labs cited in the paper, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, issued a statement on February 19 that strongly rejected any suggestion that the virus originated from its lab.  <br><br>The statement said the theory that the virus leaked from the lab was one of the false rumors that had \"great damaged our frontline researchers and seriously disrupted our urgent scientific research.\" Other rumors it rejected include \"virus was man-made,\" \"Patient Zero came from the institute\" and \"Chinese military took control of the institute.\" <br><br>Officials in the Chinese government say the source of the virus remains unknown, and that others should stop \"smearing\" the country.  <br><br>\"As a matter of fact, the source of Covid-19 is a scientific issue,\" Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister of foreign affairs, said in late March. \"We need to listen to professional and scientific opinions. The WHO has stressed many times that linking viruses to specific races, skin colors or geographical areas should be avoided. This is also the international consensus.\" <br><br>Other researchers contacted by CNN were skeptical of the lab accident theory. <br><br>\"I think it has no credibility,\" said Racaniello, who hosts a podcast called \"This Week in Virology.\" <br><br>\"I think it's part of human nature to think that we're doing the worst things, as opposed to nature.\" <br><br>Anthony, who had not heard about the paper when reached Friday, said \"it all feels far-fetched.\" <br><br>\"Lab accidents do happen, we know that, but ... there's certainly no evidence to support that theory,\" he said. <br><br>Meanwhile, tensions between the US and China over the origins of the virus -- compounded by accusations of misinformation from both sides -- are slowing the work of the virus hunters, who are grounded by the same travel restrictions that have crippled the world. <br><br>\"If there was a so-called intermediate host, an animal that the bat virus got into and then allowed it to get into people, the virus might still be in that host,\" said Daszak, the virus hunter working in China. \"And there are hundreds, thousands of these animals and farms and maybe the virus is still there. So even if we get rid of the outbreak, there's still a chance that that virus could then re-emerge and we need to find that out quickly.\" <br><br>CNN's Jenny Friedland, Dan Logan and Zac Leja contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "108", "title": "How the government delayed coronavirus testing"}, {"id": "64", "title": "In 1911, another epidemic swept through China.

Many are starting to wonder when and how these tough limits on everyday activities will end.  <br><br>Most experts agree that the only way out of a lockdown is testing. Reliable tests would allow people to know whether they have had the virus, and therefore enjoy at least a degree of immunity. They would give officials the ability to isolate new outbreaks when they emerge. <br><br>But just how would people prove their status -- and just what rights would that status confer? These are big questions that countries around the world are grappling with. <br><br>In the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock -- who has himself just emerged from self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 -- suggested that Britons who've had the virus might be issued with a certificate, which has already been dubbed an immunity passport. <br><br>\"We are looking at an immunity certificate, how people who've had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity, can show that and get back as much as possible to normal life,\" he said. On the BBC later, he said it could take the form of a wristband. <br><br>For many who have already lost their jobs or are desperate to return to work and keep businesses alive, the idea sounds like a godsend. But little is yet known about how feasible or reliable such a scheme would be -- not least because the evidence surrounding Covid-19 immunity is not clear. \"It's too early in the science of the immunity that comes from having had the disease\" to take any firm decisions now, Hancock said. <br><br>Potential challenges include finding a reliable test to determine who has antibodies for the coronavirus, establishing the level of immunity conferred by previous infection and how long it lasts, and the capacity of overstretched health systems to carry out reliable, widespread antibody tests in the general population. <br><br>Difficult social questions could also be thrown up. Could immunity passports create a kind of two-tier society, where those who have them can return to a more normal life while others remain locked down? <br><br>The UK government has already been widely criticized this week over its limited coronavirus testing capacity for frontline health care workers and others, prompting skepticism about whether it could deliver a more ambitious program. <br><br>Pressed about the immunity passport idea Friday, Hancock told UK broadcaster ITV that the UK government had not so far found an antibody test that works. <br><br>The idea of immunity certificates is \"a really smart one,\" he said. \"But as yet we're not going to bring them in because we don't know yet that the immunity is strong enough and there's still more science that needs to be done about the levels of immunity in people after they've had the disease. <br><br>\"So it's only when we have the confidence that that's reasonable are we going to do that.\" <br><br>Scientists are looking seriously at the idea, he added, including at Public Health England's laboratories at Porton Down, a top-secret government research site. <br><br>Two-tier society? <br><br>Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at England's University of East Anglia, told CNN that his first reaction on hearing Hancock's proposal was \"what a brilliant idea\" but that his thoughts had quickly turned to what could go wrong. <br><br>On the positive side, he said, \"if you get something like this, you can get people back into areas where they are going to be meeting lots of others -- health care workers, front line workers, supermarket workers, who would otherwise be at risk but once they've had the infection know that they don't need to worry they will take the infection back to their families.\" <br><br>One big downside, however, is the potential for people to act fraudulently. \"Could people pretend they were immune when they weren't because they needed to go out and earn money?\" Hunter asked. <br><br>It's also not clear whether the antibody test, once a reliable type has been developed, would be administered at home or in a healthcare setting. <br><br>\"If you are basing it on home tests, how does whoever signs your 'passport' know that you have actually read it right?\" said Hunter. \"How do they know that you have tested properly, read it properly, and the result is accurate? If you go somewhere else, how do they know that you are who you say you are and that you haven't swapped with someone who looks like you on your driving license?\" <br><br>Another more serious issue, he said, is whether people might deliberately seek to get infected in order to -- hopefully -- recover and go back to work. \"If that happens, that might undermine a lot of what we are trying to do with social distancing.\"  <br><br>But while such an immunity passport would be divisive, the inequality wouldn't last forever, Hunter points out.  <br><br>A vaccine will most likely be developed by early next year, he said, allowing those most at risk to be protected, and by then more of the population would in any case be immune. <br><br>China's color-based QR codes <br><br>The United Kingdom is not alone in grappling with the idea of how safely to end its population's confinement and get people back to work. <br><br>China, which is cautiously beginning to open back up after weeks of restrictions, is using smart phone technology to try to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus. <br><br>Residents of Hubei province, except for the city of Wuhan, were told last month that they would be allowed to leave the province if they have a green QR code on their mobile phones. <br><br>Hubei had previously ordered all its residents to obtain the color-based QR code -- which comes in red, yellow and green -- and acts as an indicator of people's health status. <br><br>The colors are assigned according to the provincial epidemic control database: people who have been diagnosed as confirmed, suspected or asymptomatic cases, or people with a fever will receive the red color code; their close contacts will receive the yellow code; and people without any record in the database will get the green code -- meaning they're healthy and safe to travel. <br><br>On April 8, the easing of restrictions will be extended to Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged in December, and residents with a green QR code will be able to leave the city and the province for the first time in more than two months.  <br><br>Officials in the city of some 11 million residents have warned people not to go out too much, however, amid fears of a renewed wave of cases.  <br><br>The authorities last week introduced strict new limits on foreigners arriving in the country, in order to prevent just such a second wave. <br><br>South Korea, which has relied on aggressive testing and contact tracing to curb the coronavirus' spread, introduced a GPS-based app to make sure that people who were self-quarantined at home stayed put. <br><br>Denmark looks to testing <br><br>One European nation, Denmark, is perhaps closer than most to lifting its lockdown.  <br><br>Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Wednesday that restrictions to curb the spread of the virus appear to be working, with hospital admissions rising at a stable rate although the virus has yet to peak there. <br><br>Unforeseen developments aside, officials say the next step will be a gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April. <br><br>Part of the plan will be to offer as much testing as possible -- not just for the virus but also for antibodies -- so people may know whether or not they have acquired a level of immunity. <br><br>Since the first case was diagnosed in Denmark on February 27, more than 104 people have died and more than 535 have been hospitalized. Denmark was among the first European countries to close its borders on March 13, and in that same week closed schools, cafes and shops, as well as banning gatherings of more than 10 people and visits to hospitals. <br><br>A combination of widespread testing with social distancing seems for now to be the most reliable way to stop the virus' spread.  <br><br>As Hancock told Britons, \"The number one thing people can do to get out of this as fast as possible is to stay at home.\" <br><br> CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Sarah Dean, Susanne Gargiulo, David Culver and Nectar Gan contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "117", "title": "Aides hope to give Trump his economic 'big bang' starting in May"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "52", "title": "A safer way to get America back to work"}, {"id": "50", "title": "Divisions on battling coronavirus deepen as Trump and Southern states push opening"}]}, "141": {"title": "Astronaut Scott Kelly on surviving isolation: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for April 3", "content": "After spending a year in space, Scott Kelly is an expert on managing extreme isolation. The retired astronaut shares valuable advice with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on how to cope with social separation here on Earth. <br><br>Announcer: And liftoff, the year in space starts now. Kelly, Kornienko and Padalka on their way towards the International Space Station.  <br><br>Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Station, this is CNN. How do you hear me? <br><br>Scott Kelly: I hear you loud and clear. Welcome aboard the space station.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: That was me talking to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly back in 2016. At that time, he was near the end of his 340 days on the International Space Station -- the longest time an American had been in space. <br><br>Many of us have been in relative isolation for weeks now. And there seems to be no clear end in sight. That can take its toll on all of us.  <br><br>In this episode, I called Scott in his home in Houston. I wanted to ask him how he survived nearly a year in space, stuck in one place and away from his friends and family. Now of course, that was space. But in some way, a lot of us are living a similar reality right now. <br><br>I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" <br><br>Announcer: And there are the two one-year crew members Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko saying hello to their crewmates and saying hello to their home for the next 12 months in space. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Scott's year in space was historic in more ways than one. Aside from breaking spaceflight records, he also participated in something called the NASA Twins Study, where scientists tracked Scott and his identical twin brother Mark, who's also a fellow astronaut, back on Earth. <br><br>They wanted to see how a human body adapted to extreme conditions in space. His twin brother was the perfect control for the study. <br><br>It put us one step closer to understanding if and how humans can reach farther planets like Mars. <br><br>Dealing with long-term isolation is one of the challenges that comes with space travel. <br><br>Right now, many of us are facing a similar challenge here on Earth. <br><br>Talk about social distancing: Scott Kelly was over 200 miles from the planet Earth. <br><br>So, I decided to ask Scott for some advice, since he is pretty uniquely qualified to talk about isolating for an extended period of time.  <br><br>Scott Kelly: First of all, you know, having a set schedule if you're lucky enough to be able to work from home, you know, schedule those work times. I would go as far as even scheduling meals. My wife and I have been making a schedule like we were in space because if you keep to that schedule and it has variety, I think what people will find are the days go by much quicker. Other things to put in the schedule: exercise. <br><br>NASA has found that astronauts in isolation have suppressed immune systems because of the isolation. And that is the last thing we need in this environment is to have our immune systems be suppressed.  <br><br>The other thing is pace yourself. For me, I think one of the most important things for me getting to the end of that mission in space was, with as much enthusiasm and energy as I had in the beginning, was the appropriate pace.  <br><br>Now, I got to ask you, Sanjay, I see you on TV all the time. Are you pacing yourself?  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: No. It's funny, as you're talking, Scott, I'm mentally making a checklist because this is all so, so important and practical. I hate to admit it. I probably suppressed my immune system from lack of sleep and all those things. But you know what? I will start pacing myself.  <br><br>Kelly: This is the inside of the crew quarters. In here, we sleep. This is where we get our change of clothes. We do brush our teeth and, you know, shave and those kinds of things. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Now, Scott wasn't completely alone. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko was always with him, as well as other crewmates who rotated in and out of the space station. <br><br>Kelly: Knowing who they're in quarantine with is very important. I mean, you got to almost treat the people you are with, almost like they are your crew.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Now, to be clear, for a lot of people, their crewmates right now is their family, but people many times are going through something they haven't gone through before, spending this kind of extended time with somebody, as much as they may love them. Do you really think that the crewmate analogy sort of helps in this case?  <br><br>Kelly: I think so, because I think about it myself with my wife. You know, I know that there are things that I'm better at than her at and there are things that she's better at (than) me. And, you know, we complement ourselves very well. <br><br>In this type of situation where our performance is so critical, people need to have a different mindset of what their family unit is right now. And it is more, you know, you are a crew together and you have a mission. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Scott also says that having a hobby is important. It helps take our mind off our current living situation. <br><br>When he was in space, Scott took up photography. He shot breathtaking photos of Earth from a porthole in the floor of a lab module. <br><br>He and his crewmates also listened to a lot of music. He said music had a way of connecting and relaxing him, no matter what his mood was. <br><br>The Dixie Chicks echoed through the International Space Station. And Pink Floyd. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You're in a type of isolation now that's different than space. You can go outside, which I imagine is a big plus compared to what it took to go outside when you were on the International Space Station. But how is the isolation different now for you?  <br><br>Kelly: Oh, it's a lot different. I said, when this -- we were about a week into this -- if I had to spend a year in space or a year in my apartment, the apartment wins every time. Not that space is not an extraordinary experience -- and I would do it again in a second -- but at least in my current situation, it's much more comfortable. It's convenient. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Sure. <br><br>Kelly: You know, when all your stuff floats all the time and the life support systems are so hard and complicated to maintain. I mean, the toilet costs $10 million and it breaks all the time. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Obviously, there was a lot of uncertainty in space. But the idea that while most people believe we will get through this period, we just don't know how long the tunnel is right now. I just wondered if you had any insights in how to deal with that.  <br><br>Kelly: Well, when I launched in March of 2015, I knew I was coming home in about a year. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Right. <br><br>Kelly: Not exactly when. But it was so far away that I couldn't even see the end of it from the beginning. <br><br>So, I think the mindset people need to be in is that: I am not looking to the end of this because I don't know. And this is my reality. This is how my life is right now. It will be over someday. <br><br>You know, I've had a lot of opportunities to be scared in my life. And what I've always found is the way you get past that is you just understand that there are certain things we have control over and certain things we don't, and the things that we don't have control over are the stuff that makes us scared. <br><br>So, focus on what you can control: taking care of yourself, your family, your schedule, your environment. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: One thing I wanted to ask you about was this idea that, you know, humans really are inherently social creatures. I don't think we realize how much our health, our physical health, sometimes is dependent on physical contact. We don't get to do that as much as things stand now. How much of an impact did that have on you? Was it something you were cognizant of when you were up in space?  <br><br>Kelly: We had a phone that we could call people. They couldn't call us, which in some ways is an advantage because you're always talking on your own terms. <br><br>It's important to stay connected. We've, you know, we've been doing these virtual happy hours with friends, some of which, you know, I'll probably be closer to after this is over as a result of it, because you have the time now and you want to connect with people. And, you know, often in our normal lives, we just, you know, we're so busy. We just don't have the time to, like, reconnect with old friends. And so hopefully that's one of the positive things that will come out of this, is that people have, you know, strengthened their relationships and friendships with people they otherwise would not have done before this pandemic.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Scott, the inevitable question, when you touch down in Kazakhstan, what will be the first things you'll want to do? Your thoughts as you emerge from a year aboard a confined environment. <br><br>Kelly: You know, seeing the sky from below and a breeze and sun, the sun on my face, running water, those kind of things. People. <br><br>You know, when you look at this Earth from space, it doesn't look all that big. You don't see political borders. It makes you think we are all part of the same team. And now, you know, with this pandemic, you realize, you know, we are all interconnected for better or for worse in this case. And our species is capable of doing amazing things. We can put people on the moon. People living in space for a year. Everything we have done in the last hundred years, we can beat this, absolutely, I am convinced. But it's gonna take an effort on all of our part, working together as a team. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: We are all in this together, no question. And Scott, you and I are in this together, and I feel really good about that. I feel like my odds are a lot better with you in the game. Thanks for joining us.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: And thank you for listening. This weekend, I hope you will all take time to connect, even remotely, with those you hold dear, as well as be available to those who need a friend right now. <br><br>And send voice memos to me about how you're connecting at asksanjay@cnn.com.

Here are the fascinating new things we've learned this week about our ancestors", "content": "It's a banner week for ancient humans. A multitude of studies are revealing intriguing new details, silencing debates about our ancient human ancestors, and strengthening their connections to modern humans. <br><br>Timelines are being pushed back, mysteries are solved and details of everyday life are revealed. Even though ancient human ancestors differ in many ways from each other, and us, there are also similarities.  <br><br>The findings point toward the shared core of humanity. Even though we've learned so much about ourselves, the ultimate question still requires a multitude of answers: Where did we come from? <br><br>Here's a look at what we've learned this week. <br><br>Homo erectus just got a little older <br><br>This is the story of three hominins, or ancient human ancestors, who all lived during the same time two million years ago in what is now South Africa's Johannesburg, called the Cradle of Humankind. But only one hominin would emerge as a survivor.  <br><br>Researchers recently discovered that Homo erectus, Austraolpithecus and Paranthropus lived at the same time. Their study published this week in the journal Science. <br><br>During excavations of the Drimolen site just outside Johannesburg, researchers found a multitude of bone fragments. They came together as the skullcap for a hominin. Its signature shape revealed that the skull came from Homo erectus.  <br><br>Homo erectus were the oldest early humans to have body proportions similar to modern humans, including an expanded brain case. The brain cavity helped the researchers determine what they were seeing. <br><br>Erectus is also known for migrating out of Africa, specifically east Africa. And until this discovery, no erectus fossils had ever been recovered in South Africa. The oldest erectus fossil came from Dmanisi, Georgia and was dated to 1.8 million years ago.  <br><br>The Drimolen skull, dubbed DNH 134, was dated to between 1.95 and 2.04 million years ago, based on the age of the site. It belonged to a young Homo erectus, only about two or three years old.  <br><br>\"The age of the DNH 134 fossil shows that Homo erectus existed 150,000 to 200,000 years earlier than previously thought,\" said study author Andy Herries, head of the department of archeology and history at La Trobe University in Australia. <br><br>This suggests that erectus may have originated in southern Africa before moving on to East and North Africa, and then the rest of the world.  <br><br>It also places Homo erectus in the same location as two other hominins who lived in South Africa at the time. <br><br>\"We can now say Homo erectus shared the landscape with two other types of humans in South Africa, Paranthropus and Australopithecus,\" Herries said. <br><br>All of them looked different from each other and they may have inhabited different areas to avoid competing for food and resources.  <br><br>\"Paranthropus robustus ate things like roots and tubers, which is why their teeth are really big. They used their enormous teeth for grinding down what we call fall-back foods -- tough hard plants,\" said Stephanie Baker, study author, researcher and PhD candidate at the Palaeo-Research Institute at the University of Johannesburg. <br><br>Homo erectus was taller and foraged for fruits and berries. They also ate meat, but researchers aren't sure how they came by it because erectus didn't use weapons, although it likely had stone tools. <br><br>During the time all three species lived in the same area, they endured climate change as it shifted from warm and humid to cool and dry. Trees gave way to grasslands.  <br><br>Homo erectus simply moved on, more mobile on two legs. Paranthropus had to settle for foods that were less appealing. And the time for Australopithecus was at an end.  <br><br>Australopithecus was like the older cousin of Paranthropus and Homo erectus. Australopithecus, who came on the scene about 3.85 million years ago, was fading especially as the habitat changed.  Although they adapted to live in trees and on land, Australopithecus likely died out due to climate change and competition from other species. <br><br>Inside Lucy's brain <br><br>About 3.18 million years ago, our ancient human ancestor Lucy walked the Earth. She belonged to a species called Australopithecus afarensis, with traits that bridged the gap between humans and chimpanzees. She was small, about 3\u00bd feet tall and 60 pounds. <br><br>Her fossils are some of the most well-known and studied ever recovered. But how did her brain work?  <br><br>Compared with chimpanzees, human brains are three times larger, are organized differently, and mature for a longer period of time, according to a study published this week in the journal Science.  In the study, researchers wanted to understand how humans achieved these social and cognitive strides because the evolution is unclear. <br><br>So they looked to fossilized skulls of afarensis, some belonging to adults and others to children and infants, like the well-known Selam toddler fossil.  <br><br>Although brains don't fossilize, the inside of well-preserved skulls can help researchers pick up clues about what they were like. CT scans of the skulls allowed them to look at the endocast, or imprint, of the brain on the skulls interior.  <br><br>Afarensis's occipital lobe, or the brain's visual center, was located toward the front of the skull, similar to modern apes. In humans, this is located toward the back of the brain. <br><br>But comparing the infant and adult skulls showed more human-like growth, with a brain that develops over a long period of time in childhood.  <br><br>They were able to determine that while afarensis' brain was organized similarly to apes, it also developed more slowly, like humans, according to the study.  <br><br>\"Lucy and her kin provide important evidence about early hominin behavior -- they walked upright, had brains that were around 20 percent larger than those of chimpanzees, and may have used sharp stone tools,\" said Zeresenay Alemseged, study co-author and  professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago. He discovered the Selam fossil in 2000. <br><br>Growth rings, like tree rings, in Selam's teeth also put the child at 2.4 years old. <br><br>\"That allows you to ask how much of the brain was formed at that given age,\" Alemseged said. <br><br>This suggests that afarensis infants depended on their caregivers for an extended amount of time.  <br><br>\"As early as 3 million years ago, children had a long dependence on caregivers,\" Alemseged said.\"That gave children more time to acquire cognitive and social skills. By understanding that childhood emerged 3.5 million years ago, we are establishing the timing for the advent of this milestone event in human evolution.\" <br><br>Homo naledi, coming of age <br><br>In 2015, fossils of a new ancient human ancestor called Homo naledi were discovered by paleoanthropologist Lee Berger in South Africa's Rising Star Cave System.  <br><br>Not much is known about these ancestors who lived between 226,000 and 335,000 years ago, but as researchers study their fossils, more secrets are unlocked.  <br><br>A recently studied partial Homo naledi skeleton provides new information about young members of this species.  <br><br>The study published this week in the journal PLOS ONE. <br><br>There's a gap in our understanding of how ancient human ancestors grew and developed because most fossils recovered belonged to adults. But this skeleton came from a young Homo naledi, between only eight and 11 years old.  <br><br>The individual is known as DH7. The teeth and bones aren't fully developed, showing that the child matured in some of the same ways as modern human children.  <br><br>Ancient human ancestors lived fast and died young, which means they developed quicker. So the researchers have to account for the fact that Homo naledi children matured slower like humans. This means that DH7 may have been as old as 15 when they died. <br><br> Further research investigating DH7 can reveal if they were more primitive or surprisingly like humans. <br><br>Enter Homo antecessor <br><br>Scientists know that modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans (a mysterious sister species of Neanderthal) had a common ancestor, considered by many scientists to be Homo erectus known as \"upright man.\"  <br><br>Now, the human family tree is gaining some more clarity.  <br><br>Between seven and nine million years ago, humans and chimpanzees went through an evolutionary split. Refining what happened after that, and how we arrived at modern humans, is more difficult. <br><br>Researchers were able to extract the oldest human genetic data from an 800,000-year-old tooth that belonged to Homo antecessor, an ancient human ancestor. <br><br>The study published this week in the journal Nature. <br><br>\"Ancient protein analysis provides evidence for a close relationship between Homo antecessor, us (Homo sapiens), Neanderthals and Denisovans. Our results support the idea that Homo antecessor was a sister group to the group containing Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans,\" said Frido Welker, study author and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Copenhagen's Globe Institute. <br><br>The new palaeoproteomics molecular method, developed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen, enables scientists to obtain evidence that pushes our understanding of human evolution even further back in time.  <br><br>\"Much of what we know so far is based either on the results of ancient DNA analysis, or on observations of the shape and the physical structure of fossils. Because of the chemical degradation of DNA over time, the oldest human DNA retrieved so far is dated at no more than approximately 400,000 years,\" said Enrico Cappellini, study author and associate professor at the University of Copenhagen's Globe Institute. \"Now, the analysis of ancient proteins with mass spectrometry, an approach commonly known as palaeoproteomics, allow us to overcome these limits.\" <br><br>The Homo antecessor fossils were found during excavations in 1994 at an archaeological site in Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain. Initially, researchers believed that Homo antecessor was the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and humans.  <br><br>This is because antecessor's skull had more modern features similar to human skulls.  <br><br>The researchers compared an analysis of the antecessor's teeth with that of a Homo erectus fossil found in Georgia that was dated to 1.77 million years. They suggest that antecessor is a sister lineage, closely related to erectus. And this finding means that the features it shares with humans have deep roots that extend even further back in time than previously thought.  <br><br>\"I am happy that the protein study provides evidence that the Homo antecessor species may be closely related to the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans,\" said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Berm\u00fadez de Castro, study co-author and scientific co-director of the excavations in Atapuerca. <br><br>Tree-climbing humans <br><br>Walking upright on two legs is considered a human trait that separates us from our ape relatives, like chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.  <br><br>But according to a new study, human ancestors were still climbing trees two million years ago, even after evolving to walk upright.  <br><br>The study published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. <br><br>Researchers analyzed leg bone fossils that belonged to an ancient human ancestor, either Paranthropus robustus or an early Homo species. The fossils were found 60 years ago in South Africa. <br><br>And at first glance, the hip joints appear more human than ape-like. This means they were walking upright. But a close analysis of the rounded head of the femur revealed that their hips were carrying weight differently and much more ape-like by hanging out in trees. <br><br>This suggests that the ancient human ancestor had highly flexed hip joints and was climbing around in trees, despite the fact that it could walk upright.  <br><br>\"It has been challenging to resolve debates regarding the degree to which climbing remained an important behavior in our past,\" said Matthew Skinner, study author and paleoanthropologist at the University of Kent. \"Evidence has been sparse, controversial and not widely accepted, and as we have shown in this study, the external shape of bones can be misleading.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "125", "title": "A real life 'Contagion': Humans may be to blame for viruses jumping from animals to us"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "34", "title": "Is the insect apocalypse really upon us?

Trump announced hours later he was extending his coronavirus guidelines another 30 days, despite a strong inclination to open the nation for business. <br><br>As the pandemic rages and Trump's response comes under withering scrutiny, Fauci and Birx -- the two top medical experts on the White House coronavirus task force -- have emerged as central figures advising Trump and fixations for a nation grappling with a generation-defining crisis. <br><br>They haven't been able to salvage an administration response pocked with early missteps, shifting public messaging and persistent delays in necessary testing and supplies. And they have found themselves repeatedly at odds with some of Trump's political and economic advisers, who have privately questioned the accuracy of their models and grumbled about their outsized influence. <br><br>But in myriad ways, Fauci and Birx have succeeded where so many in Trump's ever-rotating cast of aides have not: convincing the President to abandon his instincts, quietly contradicting him in public and remaining -- for now -- in his good graces. At a post-impeachment moment when the White House appeared intent on elevating loyalists while sidelining careerists, the longtime government officials entered Trump's orbit and managed to out-argue those with years of experience managing a mercurial boss. <br><br>There have been some signs of strain. At Thursday's task force briefing, Trump seemed alarmed when Birx suggested some Americans weren't following the distancing guidelines, causing the line of contagion to inch upward. He stepped in after she spoke, insisting certain states were doing well and saying he didn't want headlines that his recommendations were being ignored. <br><br>But he was soon back to praising his advisers' expertise, recalling hearing from Fauci and Birx that he \"may need have close it up\" to prevent further spread. <br><br>\"Close what up?\" he remembered asking. \"What's that all about?\" <br><br>Some officials working with the task force have wondered whether Fauci and Birx -- who have known each other for decades and have what each describe as a mentor-mentee relationship -- are actively calibrating their tactics into a \"good cop, bad cop\" approach. Others who are familiar with the dynamic say each is merely operating as a public health professional and presidential adviser amid the highest-stakes crisis of either of their careers. <br><br>A rapt 'student' <br><br>Trump, who is known for following his gut in most matters, has described himself as a \"student\" of Fauci and Birx's expertise, rapt by the virus wreaking havoc on the nation and his presidency. It's an accomplishment that hasn't gone unnoticed among Trump's allies, some of whom view the achievement with something like awe. <br><br>\"He listens to everything they say. No one else has come in and grabbed his attention like that,\" said one White House official who declined to be named, adding it was anybody's guess how long the current situation would last. <br><br>Other Trump allies have voiced more skepticism. After models were presented this week showing as many as 240,000 Americans could die even with strict social distancing measures in place, some Trump aides claimed privately that Fauci and Birx were being overly dire in their predictions and were not taking into account economic or political concerns. The underlying data for the models remains unknown, though Birx said she used the work of several modelers to make the projections. <br><br>Trump was adamant on Thursday that he made the right call, lending support to Fauci and Birx and suggesting he is unbothered by questions about the models' accuracy. <br><br>\"Here's the thing: they were right,\" he said. \"Everybody questioned it for a while. A good portion questioned it. They said let's keep it open, let's ride it. If we did that -- you saw the other graph. And whether it's true or almost true or maybe not true enough, the number was 2.2 million people would have died.\" <br><br>Fauci addressed the decision earlier in the week. <br><br>\"We are scientists, physicians, public health officials. We're not economists,\" he said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"We're sensitive to the idea that the economy could suffer, but it was patently obvious looking at the data, that at the end of the day if we try to push back prematurely, not only would we lose lives, but it probably would even hurt the economy.\" <br><br>Still, the stunningly bad weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, while expected, only underscored for some inside the White House that the economic argument for reopening parts of the country had lost out to the health concerns heralded by Birx and Fauci. And officials continue to raise questions internally about the staggering death projections presented earlier this week. <br><br>In meetings of the coronavirus task force, which Trump sometimes arrives to unplanned, the two immunologists have adopted somewhat different approaches, according to people familiar with the dynamic. Both bring an \"adult in the room\" level of credibility that officials say is usually well-received. <br><br>Differing approaches <br><br>As in public briefings, Fauci isn't hesitant to offer unvarnished thoughts or analysis even when it seems to contradict the President. He's warned the speed of developing a coronavirus vaccine isn't nearly where Trump has suggested it could be and he's cautioned that the possible treatments Trump touts in public haven't yet proved effective. <br><br>Frank public disagreements between Trump and a top official are virtually unprecedented in his administration. Earlier in the crisis, Trump grew enraged when an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the situation would worsen badly in the United States, believing her assessment overly fatalistic. <br><br>Blunt candor hasn't always endeared Fauci to Trump either; the President has complained in private when it seems he's being contradicted by the nation's top infectious disease specialist. But Trump has also said he prefers the direct approach and would rather his aides be more forthcoming (something few of them actually believe). <br><br>Birx, who was detailed from the State Department to act as the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has chosen a somewhat different approach. Aides describe her as patient in meetings with the President, even when he is offering lengthy medical opinions or theories that have little basis in science. Instead of interjecting or cutting Trump off, she has waited for him to finish before laying out more reality-based ideas. <br><br>She has found key areas where she is able to use her apolitical credibility to bolster Trump's proposals, including his call to limit travel from China and Europe. She was an early supporter of those steps, which Trump now cites repeatedly as evidence of his handling of the crisis, even as other areas have fallen badly short. <br><br>And she has arrived to nearly every meeting laden with folders stuffed with tables and charts, the data on which she relies to inform Trump of how the virus is spreading. While she has generally acted as a reassuring presence at daily White House briefings, it fell to Birx this week to deliver the grim models showing hundreds of thousands of potential US deaths. <br><br>Before the crisis, Trump was familiar only from afar with Fauci, who had been a regular television presence during disease outbreaks for the past three decades. However, they hadn't interacted during the first three years of Trump's term.  <br><br>Though Birx was not personally close to the President, she was able to develop a close relationship with this White House in part because Trump campaign official Matt Mowers served as her chief of staff for nearly two years, according to a source familiar with her situation. <br><br>Personal rapport <br><br>Now, after untold hours of meetings, both have developed a rapport with Trump, who has praised them as \"great geniuses.\" During Wednesday's briefing, Trump recalled Fauci's basketball prowess as a high school player in the 1950s. Birx has used personal anecdotes to relay the importance of social distancing both to Americans at large and to Trump himself. When she told reporters last month she had self-quarantined after detecting a mild fever, Trump backed away in mock horror. <br><br>Both are regular presences in the West Wing as the coronavirus response consumes the White House. Birx was given West Wing office space in mid-March and Fauci is in the building nearly every day for meetings. <br><br>\"All of a sudden, now I'm in a situation where I spend like more than an hour every day with him,\" Fauci told CNN's Sanjay Gupta in an interview this week. \"I mean, we go there, we brief him, we have a press conference, we debrief after the press conference.\" <br><br>Their efforts have earned equal amounts of scorn and praise from the political left and right, all complicated by the fact each worked under previous presidents, a trait Trump has sometimes viewed skeptically. <br><br>When Fauci was seen rubbing his forehead after Trump made an aside about the \"deep state\" in a briefing last week, online critics pounced, claiming he was insulting the President. The threats against Fauci by online conspiracy theorists and some on the far right have become so vitriolic that he is receiving enhanced security from the US Marshals Service, a request that was signed off by the Justice Department on Wednesday. <br><br>Birx has come under fire from the other side, with some of Trump's critics questioning her independence after she dismissed reports of ventilator and hospital bed shortages, despite concerns loudly voiced by hospital workers and governors. Comments she made about Trump's working style were also lambasted as overly obsequious by some on the left. <br><br>\"He has been so attentive to the details and the data, and his ability to analyze and integrate data has been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues,\" she told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview last week. <br><br>Both have also been headliners in an administration response hobbled by testing failures and delays in distributing badly needed supplies, not to mention the two months Trump spent downplaying the risk of contagion to the US. Whatever success they have had in convincing the President to do more to prevent the disease's spread will inevitably be viewed alongside the larger failures in the response. <br><br>So far, however, their presence inside the White House has provided some reassurance to Americans worried at how the federal government is handling the pandemic. And -- for now at least -- they are holding their ground. <br><br>\"We argued strongly with the President that he not withdraw those guidelines after 15 days but that he extend them, and he did listen,\" Fauci said on CNN this week. \"Dr. Debbie Birx and I went into together in the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said, here are the data, take a look. He looked at them, he understood them, and he just shook his head and said, 'I guess we've got to do it.' \" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}, {"id": "152", "title": "The dangerous disconnect between Trump's rhetoric and the reality for potential coronavirus treatments"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}]}, "145": {"title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic", "content": "Curnow is a CNN anchor and host of CNN International's \"CNN Newsroom with Robyn Curnow.\" The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. <br><br> (CNN)The sickness is hidden at first; nobody knows if they have it, if they are a carrier. There is confusion too. Many questions about how the infection spreads. People don't curb risky behavior. Scientists warn about exponential growth in the number of cases. People start to get sick. They cough, gasp for breath, become too weak to get out of bed. Often alone. So much death. Families, clinics, hospitals, entire communities are overwhelmed. It is a virus; new and not understood, contagious and indiscriminate.  <br><br>  <br><br>For a time, the President does not listen to the virologists, or the doctors who are treating the growing numbers of the afflicted. He does not track epidemiologists' warnings or pay attention to their mapped-out projections. Neither does he implement his own government's plan of action. He refuses to acknowledge there is a problem. He waits, obfuscates, delays. He politicizes a national health crisis. He confuses his own people with half-baked ideas and random conspiracy theories. He blames others for bringing the virus to his people. <br><br>  <br><br>When the situation deteriorates to the point that he is forced eventually to do something, his messages are still mixed and his response is piecemeal. The damage is done. The virus penetrates deep into the heartland, spread by inaction, misinformation and a dire lack of leadership at crucial moments when the infection could have been slowed. <br><br>I'm not talking about America today. All of this happened over two decades ago, in my home country of South Africa, where for years President Thabo Mbeki refused to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic rampaging across the nation. By the time he did, South Africans had paid a terrible price. And while the differences between HIV/AIDS and Covid-19 are myriad, some stark lessons from the past have crystallized for me. <br><br>  <br><br>Over the past few weeks, I have watched and listened as President Donald Trump got off to a stumbling start with echoes of Mbeki's mistakes. For those of us who have witnessed both Mbeki's long denial of the AIDS epidemic and Trump's response to the coronavirus emergency, there are alarming similarities between these men's behavior at the early stages of a public health crisis. The most simple and heartbreaking connection between both is that their delayed response impacted the lives of those they swore an oath to protect. In South Africa, a doctoral thesis by a student at the Harvard School of Public Health estimated more than 330,000 South Africans unnecessarily died between 2000-2005 because of the Mbeki government's obstruction of treatment.  <br><br>  <br><br>Trump may finally be getting to grips with the gravity of the situation, thus dropping his talk of filling churches for Easter, extending federal social distancing measures to April 30 and acknowledging that more than 100,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 -- perhaps more than 2 million if \"we did nothing.\"  But disconnects remain, with Trump saying that if there are fewer than 100 000 deaths -- almost twice as many as American soldiers killed in Vietnam -- \"we all together have done a very good job.\" In addition, the President has pitted state governors against each other, equated the virus with the common flu, denied there are shortages in critical protective equipment and refused to take early warning models seriously -- leaving states, hospitals and medical staff unprotected and unprepared. Since this novel coronavirus has the ability to quickly spread largely undetected in the absence of robust testing in the United States, each day of indecision and misdirection has cost the country dearly in terms of preparation and allocation of badly needed resources. <br><br>  <br><br>Both Mbeki and Trump put off taking quick, bold decisions because they were distracted by false information. The US President likes to take his cue from Fox News which, for weeks, downplayed the threat and suggested that the clamoring calls for more action and preparation was just liberal hysteria targeting 'his' economy and chances of reelection.  <br><br>  <br><br>In South Africa, Mbeki -- who took office as the widely respected successor to Nelson Mandela -- spent hours on the internet, often late into the night, finding articles and connecting with those who dismissed the links between HIV and AIDS. He downplayed the virus -- like Trump in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic -- saying it was not a potent medical threat.  <br><br>  <br><br>Mbeki suggested that the science behind HIV/AIDS and antiretroviral drugs was a conspiracy by large pharmaceutical companies and Western (white) countries to perpetuate insulting stereotypes about African sexuality and masculinity. His own political party could not, or would not, disagree with him. His doubts became the foundation of a compromised health system. Even after anti-retrovirals became available his administration actively opposed and delayed the deployment of the drugs. The government actually went as far as refusing to roll out medication known to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It took a Constitutional Court ruling to force the government to give a single dose of nevirapine to mothers in labor and their infants within 72 hours of birth. An estimated 35,000 babies were born with HIV as a direct consequence of the Mbeki government's failure to manage and distribute available medical resources.       <br><br>Trump too has suggested others (the Chinese) are to blame for the virus.    <br><br>  <br><br>In South Africa, Mbeki and his ill-prepared health minister advocated a regime of eating vegetables such as beetroot and African wild potatoes to protect against infection. The underlying premise was correct -- a good diet with plenty of vitamins could boost immune systems. However, the mixed messages soon were misinterpreted and confused South Africans who thought some local vegetables could protect against AIDS. <br><br>  <br><br>Certainly Trump isn't refusing to allow Americans the benefit of new treatments in the way that Mbeki did 20 years ago. But he seems to have ignored expert warnings about the threat of a global pandemic when he took office in 2017. And his over the top optimism about a yet unproven drug  generated some confusion when he used anecdotal evidence to declare that variants of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine might be a treatment for coronavirus. After he mentioned it at a briefing, a Phoenix couple tried to self-medicate with a non- pharmaceutical version of it -- an additive used to clean fish tanks. The man died and the woman had to be admitted to critical care.  In Nigeria, health officials said three people had overdosed on the drug after Trump's comments. (The FDA has since granted emergency authorization to use the drug. This drug may yet prove effective but in the meantime public health officials are left to clean up this confusion urging people not to hoard the drug so that those who need it for treatment of things like lupus can get their regular prescription filled. <br><br>  <br><br>Mbeki's administration eventually corrected course, but not before hundreds of thousands of lives were lost. Even today, the more than 7 million South Africans living with HIV must still confront the stigma born in those early few years of the epidemic.  <br><br>Coronavirus and HIV/AIDS are, of course, different diseases. But Mbeki demonstrated to the world the tragic cost if leaders fumble their initial responses to a pandemic. Leadership is about taking tough decisions, gaming out strategies and putting lives above politics. History has shown there is a hideous price to be paid for ignoring medical science. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "146", "title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists"}, {"id": "144", "title": "How Fauci and Birx got Trump to listen to science"}]}, "146": {"title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists", "content": " Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the forthcoming book, \"Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\" Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer.

But if there is one glimmer of hope in this global nightmare, it's that it may inspire a generation of Americans to consider pursuing careers in the medical and scientific fields, just as other crises have inspired past generations in particular ways.   <br><br>  <br><br>In the current battle to stop the spread of Covid-19 and move us toward some sort of recovery, the men and women working in health care and medical research are our troops. They are the modern-day version of the greatest generation from World War II -- the tens of thousands of people who sacrificed their lives to combat fascism in the 1940s. <br><br>  <br><br>This time around, the heroes operate in laboratories and hospital rooms. And they are doing everything possible to treat those who have the virus, develop a vaccine to combat future outbreaks and employ the best statistical techniques to track how the pandemic is unfolding. And, regardless of the national politics, these health care workers keep their heads down and do the work that is so badly needed.  <br><br>  <br><br>We have gone through other periods when crises of this magnitude have motivated younger generations of Americans to pursue professions that meet the needs of those moments. After the Great Depression, young men and women entered into public service at the federal or state level, seeing government as a force for good in American life. Wilbur Cohen, for example, started his career as a staffer on Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security, which helped design Social Security -- and spent much of the remainder of his career working in the Social Security apparatus.  <br><br>  <br><br>And a young Texan named Lyndon Johnson came to work for a congressman in 1931, then led the Texas National Youth Administration in 1935. Johnson was responsible for administering money for jobs, education and more to young Texans. These experiences strengthened his resolve to run for a House seat in 1937 and to spend several decades in Congress before becoming president, during which he would seek to go beyond FDR's New Deal with the Great Society.  <br><br>  <br><br>People like Cohen and Johnson understood that public policy -- and federal legislation -- helped save the nation from the ravages of economic hardship during the Great Depression. More specifically, programs like Social Security, the Public Works Administration, the Civil Works Administration and others offered economic security -- and even jobs -- when unemployment soared. As a result of these programs, between 1950 and 1975, one out of every four jobs in the non-farm economy was in government. <br><br>  <br><br>Following  the Vietnam War and Watergate in the 1970s, when investigative journalists helped to uncover political falsehoods that had justified a terrible war and exposed the corruption of power that had taken place in Richard Nixon's White House, more Americans decided to devote their lives to the newsroom, determined to never miss those kinds of stories ever again. \"Applications to journalism school are at an all-time high,\" Time magazine noted in a cover story during the summer of 1974, \"and many of the youngsters say that they want to be investigative reporters.\" <br><br>  <br><br>Tim O'Brien, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who worked for Bloomberg and the New York Times, was 12 when he learned about the Watergate hearings in summer camp. After seeing \"All the President's Men\" in 1976, where Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman glorified the work that Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had done for the Washington Post, he was inspired to pursue a career as a journalist -- remarking: \"'Wow, these are the guys that set everything in motion.'\" <br><br>  <br><br>Now, following the death toll from the coronavirus, we see why medicine, science and public health are so critical to functioning of our society -- a reality that will continue to be true as the threat of future pandemics remains. <br><br>  <br><br>When this the coronavirus has been beaten -- and it will be one day -- we will need the government to provide financial support for individuals who want to enter these fields, as we saw after World War II when politicians in both parties poured millions of dollars into the coffers of universities and research institutions that were engaged in work relevant to the Cold War through the National Defense Education Act. <br><br>  <br><br>We will need high schools to develop new STEM programs to maximize interest in these fields, and we will need universities to dedicate even greater resources toward nurturing those who seek to pursue careers in the sciences. There will have to be discussions about whether there are needs to streamline the graduate training process and to make any necessary changes to the curriculum. It will also be essential to provide better solutions to crushing student debt.  <br><br>  <br><br>Lastly, we will need parents to tell their children the stories that they witnessed and experienced, as our nation sheltered in place for weeks on end. <br><br>  <br><br>National crises are horrendous to live through. They scar generations and wreak havoc on our lives. But they also expose elements of society that we have all but ignored -- and shine a spotlight on professionals who perhaps were not receiving the credit they deserved. <br><br>  <br><br>We will never forget the sacrifices that our health care workers and scientists are making right now.  And hopefully, as a result, their ranks will be strengthened, so that we are better prepared to deal with this sort of threat if and when it emerges again. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}, {"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Burns, the film follows the spread of a virus transmitted when sick humans touch surfaces and leave virus behind that others can catch. Next comes the frantic attempts by public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the anarchy that unfolds amid a pandemic, and the ultimate introduction of a vaccine to stop the spread. Sound like a plot we're in the middle of? <br><br>Its prescience was bolstered by Burns consulting with representatives of the World Health Organization on the ins and outs of infectious diseases, and by Kate Winslet working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand the lifestyle and character of an epidemiologist charged with leading the world through crisis. <br><br>The filmmakers also consulted medical experts including Dr. W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant. Lipkin is the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Health. He recently contracted the novel coronavirus.   <br><br>Laurie Garrett also served as a consultant on the film because she wrote the 1994 book \"The Coming Plague\" and reported on multiple pandemics. In a 2001 article she wrote for CNN, Garrett described \"Contagion\"as \"part fantasy, part reality and totally possible.\"  <br><br>Here is how the virus and drama of \"Contagion\" compares with the real life coronavirus pandemic as it currently stands.  <br><br>Virus origins <br><br>The final scene in \"Contagion\" reveals that the fictional \"MEV-1\" virus originated from a pig that ate a piece of banana dropped by an infected bat escaping the destruction of its palm tree forest habitat in China.  <br><br>That pig is then slaughtered and prepared by a chef who, without washing them first, shakes hands with Beth Emhoff (played by Gwyneth Paltrow), thus transmitting the virus to her. Emhoff becomes the \"index case,\" meaning she was the first identified case.    <br><br>The origin of the novel coronavirus terrorizing us today is still a mystery to scientists. It will only be solved if they're able to isolate the live virus in a suspected species (like in the movie), which can be difficult.   <br><br>However, like \"Contagion,\" bats are considered by some epidemiologists to be the possible source of the coronavirus.  <br><br>Zoologists, ecologists and disease experts have told CNN that human behaviors -- such as destroying natural habitats -- might be to blame for the transfer of the disease. <br><br>When bats are stressed, which can occur from destruction of their habitats, their typically strong immune system is challenged, which makes it harder to cope with pathogens they could usually fight off. This allows an increase in infections and the shedding of them. <br><br>One theory on the origin of the current coronavirus is that the initial epicenter was likely a \"wet market\" in Wuhan, China. In \"wet markets,\" wild animals that also may be infected and stressed are held together and sold as food or pets, leading to a mix of viruses and species.  <br><br>Any \"zoonotic spillover,\" or the transfer of disease from animals to humans, is exacerbated by population density and public transport, which make it easy for a virus to spread rapidly.  <br><br>Scientists studying the spread of the coronavirus have provided another theory: It may have spread into humans from animals in a less deadly form and circulated at low levels in humans for years before adapting to us and becoming seriously infectious, according to recent research published in the journal Nature Medicine.  <br><br>If the \"Contagion\" bats were under stress from the palm tree destruction, the origin of the \"Contagion\" virus could mirror the potential origin of the current coronavirus.  <br><br>Similar symptoms <br><br>Sick people in the film experienced fevers and profuse sweating, pounding headaches, sore throat and cough but also had seizures, dizziness and frothed at the mouth when they passed.  <br><br>The signs of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Covid-19 are similar, but there haven't been any reports of seizures or frothing at the mouth. Covid-19 symptoms include primarily a fever of at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), cough or trouble breathing, according to the CDC.  <br><br>Emergency warning signs of Covid-19 include \"persistent pain or pressure in the chest,\" \"bluish lips or face\" -- indicating a lack of oxygen -- and sudden mental confusion, fatigue or inability to rouse.  <br><br>Less common symptoms of Covid-19 include those typically experienced during flu and cold: headaches, digestive issues, body aches and fatigue, and a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing.  <br><br>Anosmia, a lack of sense of smell, and dygeusia, a lack of taste, are symptoms that might flag Covid-19 in its early stages among patients with a mild case.  <br><br>Transmission <br><br>Like Covid-19, the film's MEV-1 is a respiratory disease, carried in expelled droplets of saliva from a sneeze or cough or other secretions. It spreads directly between people when those droplets reach the eyes, nose or mouth of an uninfected person. <br><br>The film's virus is also transmitted by fomites, or surfaces that have been contaminated with infections after sick humans touch them.  <br><br>The spreading of MEV-1 is exacerbated by the average person touching their face a few thousand times per day -- while in between, they're touching door handles, elevator buttons, subway poles and each other.  <br><br>Evidence shows that the novel coronavirus transmits through the same mechanisms, according to the World Health Organization.  <br><br>Actors from \"Contagion\" recently urged people to \"control the contagion\" by washing their hands, practicing social distancing and following the advice of health experts In a series of PSAs from Columbia Public Health.  <br><br>Can you be immune to the virus? <br><br>The fictional Mitch Emhoff (played by Matt Damon), husband of index case Beth, is found to be immune to the virus. He dodges the deliberately targeted coughs of strangers in grocery stores and survives through the film physically unscathed.  <br><br>Today, there are no reports of people biologically immune to getting the novel coronavirus. But can one be immune to the novel coronavirus after recovering from it? Scientists aren't sure yet.  <br><br>In the March 26 CNN Global Town Hall: Coronavirus Facts and Fears, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked physician Dr. Leana Wen whether a person can be immune to the virus via antibodies they developed after having and recovering from the disease.  <br><br>\"This is what we want to get to,\" she responded. \"We don't have that test yet. It's being developed. But that would be great. It would be so helpful for people to know whether they have immunity.\"  <br><br>And if someone could be immune, we don't yet know how long it could last for.  <br><br>\"There are some people who speculate that one might have immunity for a long time, even forever, but we just don't know yet,\" she added.  <br><br>The R0 <br><br>The number of people a sick person is likely to infect is called the R0, or R-naught, of a virus. The R0 of the fictional MEV-1 virus was 4, while the R0 of coronavirus is 2.2, according to a recent study of data from the first cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan and investigations conducted by Chinese and American health officials.  <br><br>They found the epidemic doubled about every seven days. In other words, on average, each Covid-19 patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 people.  <br><br>The mortality rate  <br><br>The mortality rate of the \"Contagion\" virus, or the percentage of those that die among an infected population, was estimated to be about 25% to 30%. <br><br>As of March 26, the mortality rate among patients with Covid-19 is between 1.8% to 3.4%, according to the CDC.  <br><br>An unproven remedy: Forsythia vs. chloroquine  <br><br>In \"Contagion,\" blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) pushes forsythia, a floral homeopathic tincture, as the cure for the virus, although studies hadn't proved it worked. <br><br>He appeared to have recovered from the virus shortly after taking forsythia, and anxious customers clamored for prescriptions of the remedy from their local pharmacies as well as on Krumwiede's blog. He attracted more 12 million followers and several million dollars from the false claim, according to the film. <br><br>Law, in the production notes for the film, described his character as the \"'index patient' for what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic\" based on mistrust of news media, the government and health officials.   <br><br>There are currently no cures or vaccines for Covid-19, yet the drugs chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine have been called \"game changers\" by President Donald Trump. Both drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria and other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  <br><br>A man living in Phoenix died and his wife was in critical care after the two took a non-pharmaceutical version of chloroquine in an attempt to prevent contracting the virus. His wife said he heard Trump tout the drug in a news conference.  <br><br>On March 29, the FDA issued a limited emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with Covid-19.  <br><br>Despite limited evidence on the efficacy of the drugs for Covid-19, the US Department of Human Health Services said in a statement that anecdotal reports suggest they may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized patients. The FDA said the benefits outweigh the risks.  <br><br>A path toward a vaccine  <br><br>In \"Contagion,\" CDC research scientist Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) stresses that it can take months, maybe a year, to be able to distribute a vaccine after testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution. However, Hextall speeds up the process by inoculating herself with the final experimental vaccine, then is able to provide doses for human use in just several months. <br><br>In reality, leading infectious disease experts say the typical vaccine takes between 8 and 10 years to develop. American health officials are trying to fast track that time frame, as are laboratories around the world.  <br><br>Currently a year to 18 months is an optimistic time window for a possible coronavirus vaccine, Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, previously told CNN.  <br><br>That said, a novel coronavirus vaccine Phase I trial in the US gave the first dose to test the safety of the vaccine to a participant in March. This trial is meant to establish that the vaccine is safe and that participants immune systems respond well, but proving the vaccine effectively prevents infection will take many more months.  <br><br>Life as we haven't known it  <br><br>In \"Contagion,\" civil unrest rips at the fabric of society, leaving banks and grocery stores ransacked. Police seemed unable to respond to crime, as martial law prohibited travel between states to stop the spread of the virus.  <br><br>That hasn't happened in real life. But, as in the film, a lot of us have spent weeks separated from friends, family and places we love, wondering when the pandemic will end so we can get back to life as we've known it. People are under variations of restrictions on movement, including social distancing guidelines, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. On March 29, Trump extended social distancing guidelines to April 30.  <br><br>In one of the final scenes of the film, after successful distribution of vaccines, people wait in an airport to board their flight. Some still wear masks, but when a man in line drops something, the man behind him touches his shoulder to catch his attention, then leans down to pick the item up for him. The man seems grateful. Naivety? Or, maybe it's a sign that the worst is behind them. <br><br>Fictional CDC head Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) gives the son of a CDC custodian his own intranasal vaccine near the end of the film. The boy hesitantly shakes Cheever's hand, expressing his gratitude.  <br><br>\"You know where this comes from, shaking hands?\" Cheever asked. \"It was a way of showing a stranger that you weren't carrying a weapon in the old days. You offered your empty right hand to show that you meant no harm.\" <br><br>If there are any concrete takeaways \"Contagion\" offers us, it's a reminder to stop touching your face, and a beacon of hope that this too shall pass.  <br><br>We can only hope we will one day be able to reach out and touch again, thankful that our pandemic is over.  <br><br>CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Vasco Cotovio, Sandee LaMotte, Jen Christensen and Arman Azad contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

While Trump touts them as miracle drugs that are on the brink of saving lives, experts are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence. <br><br>This dynamic has played out over the past few weeks, and was on full display again during the White House briefing on Tuesday. Trump said the drugs might be a \"total game-changer\" and implied that good news from clinical trials was just days away, only to be corrected by the nation's top infectious disease expert, who steered clear of glowing superlatives and said the research will take months, \"at very best.\" <br><br>The medicines -- chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine -- have been used for decades to fight malaria. But this week, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization for doctors to use them to treat Covid-19 in hospitalized patients. This was the first step in getting millions of pills to the states, though hospitals have been using the drugs for coronavirus without explicit government approval for weeks. <br><br>Even in making this landmark announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously gave a tempered assessment of the potential benefits. A press release said, \"anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit\" in coronavirus patients, but \"clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.\" <br><br>That tone is entirely different from what the President has been saying at daily briefings. Millions of stuck-at-home Americans watched him claim that the drugs have \"tremendous promise\" and \"could be a game changer,\" and that they are \"very effective\" and \"can be taken safely.\" <br><br>Trump went even further on Tuesday, falsely suggesting that the drugs have already been proven safe. \"Very powerful drug, but it's been out there for a long time,\" he said at the daily White House coronavirus briefing. \"So, it's tested in the sense that you know it doesn't kill you.\" <br><br>Doctors say he's wrong, and that comments like these could have deadly consequences. <br><br>A man in Arizona died after ingesting a form of chloroquine used to treat aquariums. There have been at least three overdoses in Nigeria as well. There are reports of hoarding by doctors and shortages, where people with lupus and other diseases who also use the drugs can't get them. <br><br>\"As the dose of chloroquine goes up, it goes from being safe and effective to highly toxic, quickly,\" said Dr. Christopher Plowe, a renowned malaria expert at the Duke Global Health Institute. \"It's very easy to overdose on chloroquine. You get above the ceiling of safety pretty quickly. There are some very serious risks here. There's quite a bit to lose, including your life.\" <br><br>Experts like Plowe who study these drugs, and doctors who are prescribing them, agree with the public health officials that clinical trials will tell whether Trump's optimism is well-placed.  <br><br>Testing is underway, including a large study in New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with more than 75,000 cases, the most of any state in the country. New York public health authorities have obtained at least 1 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, which will be used for a large-scale clinical trial, an official at the New York State Department of Health told CNN.   <br><br>Other states, like Michigan, are still asking the Trump administration for their share of the drugs. <br><br>The pharmaceutical giant Novartis recently donated 30 million hydroxychloroquine tablets to the federal government as part of the new push to get the drug to patients who need it. Asked if the company agrees with Trump's view that the drugs might be the most significant breakthrough in modern medicine, a spokeswoman told CNN, \"We believe you need to follow the science.\" <br><br>Optimism versus science <br><br>French researchers published a small study on March 17, suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were effective against the coronavirus. The results were met with caution: Public health officials noted that the research was conducted by a controversial doctor, it only included 24 patients, didn't follow typical rules for randomized trials, and was not peer-reviewed. <br><br>Regardless, within 48 hours, Trump sprang into action and began touting the study and the drugs, and has done so at least a dozen times in two weeks, according to a CNN analysis. <br><br>The medical community immediately noticed the disconnect between Trump's posture and the science. A stark headline from The New York Times read, \"Trump's Embrace of Unproven Drugs to Treat Coronavirus Defies Science.\" Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, ran a similar piece quoting a leading Australian medical researcher who said, \"this is insane!\" <br><br>Senior Trump administration officials and public health experts followed suit, partially walking back Trump's comments with their own tempered takes, often from the very same podium. <br><br>When a journalist asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, if these medicines could prevent Covid-19, Fauci gave a crystal-clear response: \"The answer is no.\" <br><br>Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House's coronavirus task force, said, \"We're trying to figure out how many anecdotal reports equal real scientific breakthrough,\" when asked about the drugs. <br><br>The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said a \"large, pragmatic clinical trial\" is still needed to \"actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,\" as to whether the drugs are effective and safe to use during the worsening coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>A little-noticed Pentagon report, written by military doctors and released amid Trump's barrage of optimism, said, \"(Bottom line up front): No high-quality evidence exists to support use at present.\" The 51-page report of best practices, which has been circulating among American physicians, warned that the drugs have toxic side effects and can lead to cardiac complications.  <br><br>The report said more research is needed to corroborate the French study. If those early results are accurate, \"this would be the first time chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was found to be effective for the clinical management of a viral infection,\" the report said, because previous clinical trials determined that the drugs had no impact on other viruses like influenza and HIV. <br><br>Balancing benefits and risks <br><br>Senior public health officials like Fauci and Hahn have said Trump wants to strike an optimistic tone to keep hope alive among Americans who are worried about their health and their paycheck. But there are risks, both to public health and in the presidential campaign unfolding in the background, in over-promising when it comes to things like drug treatments during an epidemic.  <br><br>\"Medical history has so many examples of treatments that people had good experiences with, and people got better, and they had great confidence in the treatment, and years later when a randomized trial was done, it turned out no better than placebo,\" said Plowe, the Duke expert. <br><br>Even with that uncertainty, some doctors on the frontlines say there aren't many other options. <br><br>Former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, now a surgeon in the Kansas City area who is treating patients with Covid-19, applauded the FDA's decision to let hospitals use the anti-malaria drugs, which he promoted in two columns in The Wall Street Journal and interviews with Fox News hosts. <br><br>\"The FDA made a difficult decision, but they were right,\" Colyer told CNN. \"We won't have all the hard data we want for months. But at this point, this is one of the most promising treatments out there. We need to understand all these drugs better, but we're in a unique situation.\" <br><br>Before the pandemic, the Trump administration named Colyer chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health, within the Department of Health and Human Services. Colyer, a Republican, told CNN he is informally advising the Trump administration on the virus.  <br><br>Regardless of Trump's glowing rhetoric about the medicines, Colyer said the FDA \"made a finding after reviewing all the literature\" that is available, even though the research is limited. <br><br>\"They've seen the plusses and the minuses and made a professional decision,\" he added. <br><br>CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Brynn Gingras and Tara Subramaniam contributed to this article. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "108", "title": "How the government delayed coronavirus testing"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to Fauci about his personal life, career and navigating his current position straddling both science and politics.  <br><br>Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: This is so different, Sanjay, than any anything else that I've experienced, despite the, you know, 40-plus years I've been doing this.  <br><br>Dr. Sanjay Gupta: That's Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. He's now one of the most recognizable leaders fighting this pandemic.  <br><br>Fauci's signature gravelly voice -- a result of the copious press conferences, briefings and interviews he's been doing -- combined with his calm, evidence-based assurances, have become such a comfort to Americans lately that when he missed two White House briefings in a row, the hashtag #whereisdrfauci started trending on Twitter.  <br><br>Even at the age of 79, the nation's top infectious disease doctor has been working around the clock. But he found time to talk to me for this episode.  <br><br>I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" <br><br>We've seen Dr. Fauci in front of the cameras at the White House briefings answering reporters' questions. His advice to the nation has had a profound effect on how we are all navigating this crisis.  <br><br>But behind the cameras, when he's not working, Tony Fauci and his family are adapting to this new reality much like the rest of us.  <br><br>I asked him how he's coping on a personal level.  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, I'm doing fine, Sanjay. It's very exhausting. I think maybe about three or four weeks ago, I realized that I was really running myself completely into the ground. And it was the wisdom of my wife -- who is the head of the Department of Bioethics at the NIH but before that she was a nurse and still is a nurse, and she's a pretty good clinician -- and she sort of said, \"Tony, you just got to really be careful because you're going to burn out in about a week.\" So, with that, what I did is, I didn't say, pull back, but I started to make sure that I ate. Like, I would go a whole day without eating anything just because I was so busy, I just didn't have time to eat. And the adrenalin was so high that it doesn't make you hungry. And then I find that at the end of the day, I'm feeling hypoglycemic and I don't know why. And then my wife goes, \"Duh, you're hypoglycemic because you didn't eat anything.\" And it's the same thing with sleep. So, I'm really trying now, to the best as possible, to get five hours. I was getting three to four, which doesn't work for me, Sanjay. I'm not at my best at three to four.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Right. I mean, I think nobody would be. And even five, as you know, is probably not enough. I know you probably don't have time to run and do things like that, because I know you're very active, but would you run outside?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, I would. I mean that there's a little bit of a, I wouldn't say controversy, but there's something we need to sort out here, because, by the way last night, I got back from the White House press conference a little bit earlier because it was less of going on and on and on and on the way it happens sometimes. And so she and I went out for a run last night in (the) dark.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Really?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Yeah. And that answers your question. You know, we're telling people to hunker down, stay in. And then on the other hand, it just makes sense that if you don't want to go stir crazy, if you can get outside and really physically separate yourself, don't just go outside and congregate and see the neighbors and schmooze. But actually, just go out. So, my wife and I went out last night and you know, on the streets of Washington -- we live in northwest DC -- the streets of Washington were essentially deserted. We passed a few people. We passed them well beyond 6 feet of physical separation. So, frankly, Sanjay, I don't see anything wrong with that.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You have had medicine and health in your family for a long time. You grew up in Brooklyn. Your family owned a pharmacy. Was that what sort of inspired you to go into medicine?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, a little bit, Sanjay. I don't think overwhelming. Probably the thing that got me to go into medicine is that I'm very much of a people person. But also, I'm very analytical and I'm very scientific. And I was trying to figure out how do you, how do you mesh those two together? How do you do something that's evidence-based, science-based but absolutely has to do with people? You know, I grew up as an Italian-American Catholic boy from Brooklyn. I had Jesuit training my entire educational career. And the one theme that was always underlying our interactions was service for others. So, if you put science, I like people, service for others -- that was medicine. It was the NIH, when I went down to the NIH that got me introduced to science that got me involved with what I'm doing now. Fundamentally, I'm a physician. And, and when I think of my identity, it's a physician.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Well, I think everybody in the world thinks of you that way, Dr. Fauci. Let me let me ask a couple questions about December of 2019. When you first heard about this novel coronavirus, the early reports out of China, what was your initial response?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: I was concerned, but it was a muted concern. In fact, it goes back even before it was discovered to be a coronavirus because we were hearing these reports of a strange pulmonary illness out of China that may be associated with wet markets. When I heard it was a coronavirus, the only thing I said -- not the only thing, but one of the things I said -- to myself: \"Let's hope that it remains difficult to readily transmit from human to human.\" In an interview, I don't even know when, but something that you interviewed me 20 years ago, whenever it was, you asked me, \"What keeps you up at night? What worries you?\" And if you go back, I told you, I said: \"It's a respiratory-borne illness. It may be influenza, but maybe it isn't influenza that has multiple characteristics. One, it's readily transmissible from human to human. And two, it has a high degree of morbidity and mortality.\" That's the nightmare that everybody who's in infectious diseases always worries about. And here we are in, you know, in 2020, it's happened.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting because I remember that conversation well, and I think it's really affected how I report about all of these outbreaks, epidemics and even pandemics over the last 20 years now. And in January 2017, you gave a talk at Georgetown University about the challenges the next administration might face. And you said there is going to be a surprise outbreak. That was incredibly spot on. You were prophetic on this. Why were you so convinced there would be a surprise outbreak?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Well, you know, that was a lecture I put together at the end of the Obama administration because I reflected back that I had advised five presidents up to that time. And I noticed with some curiosity and impending concern that every one of the presidents that I've dealt with have been confronted with a substantial public health crisis. You know, Reagan with HIV into George H.W. Bush with HIV. You know, Clinton had a couple of West Nile and a few other things. Then, George W. With anthrax and then again with Ebola, and then Obama with Ebola. And then I said, you know, \"It's eerie, but I don't know what it's gonna be. But as we enter into this new administration, there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to get challenged with an unexpected outbreak.\" I didn't anticipate it would be as bad as this, but it certainly is unexpected.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: This is not at all a political question, but I'm just wondering in terms of style, you have spent so much time with so many different presidents. Is it typically the same sort of way of interacting? Do you make appointments and you meet in the Oval Office? Is there a certain casualness or is there always a formality to it? How do you describe those meetings?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, they're different with every president, Sanjay. And within a given presidency, it's different. You know, I mean, I could give so many different examples. With George H.W. Bush, just by accident I developed a really close friendship with him because he came to the NIH in the in the late '80s when he was vice president and was thinking of running for president. And he sincerely wanted to learn about HIV. He was a very modest, unbelievable human being. And he came in, he says, \"I want to learn.\" So, he came to the NIH and I gave him a bit of a tutorial on HIV. I introduced him to patients, et cetera. He was very struck by that. And all of a sudden, he decided he was going to be my friend. Thank goodness. And he invited me to the White House, and we had a very warm, personal-type relationship. That was different. I mean, with Clinton, Clinton had all the right vibes about what to do. I had a good relationship with him, but it was quite formal, as you would have with respect to the presidency. With George W. Bush, I mean, it started off in crises because we had 9/11. We had anthrax. So, I got to know him under crises situation. And then subsequent to that, you know, I had the privilege of being close to him and developing PEPFAR, which to me was one of the most important things any American president has ever done.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: For our listeners, can you just tell us, what that is?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: PEPFAR is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which was established by President Bush in 2003, in which he marshaled an extraordinary amount of resources to help the people in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, who were challenged with an amazing degree of pain and suffering with HIV AIDS. I believe it is one of the most important mandates from a United States president in history because it saved millions of lives. So, a lot of credit goes to President George W. Bush for doing that. With Obama, Obama, you know, just a very easy person to get along with and a really good human being. And we had multiple crises. We had Ebola, we had Zika.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: H1N1 --  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Yeah, it was a marathon of infec--, of you know, he even, he didn't joke about it because he was serious. But I remember once he walked into the Situation Room and we were sitting around and he just put his hand on his head. He said, \"I got, I got children at the border, I got wars going on, and I'm spending all my time with these diseases. Would you guys please do something about this?\" It was, it was sort of like almost tongue-in-cheek, but it was serious. And then now, we're faced here. You know, I had no interaction with President Trump for the first three-plus years because there was not any reason to interact. We were doing our job. You know, he was doing what he was doing. And then when this came along, all of a sudden, now I'm in a situation where I spend like more than an hour every day with him. I mean, we go there, we brief him, we have a press conference, we debrief after the press conference. And it's like the answer to your question, a little bit long-winded, is that it's very different with each president, and it's dictated almost completely by the circumstances that you're under.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Do you feel like you're being listened to? And let me give a little context to the question, because this is just my own observation as we talk on this podcast, that I feel like you've known a lot of the answers and a lot of the strategic direction things are gonna go earlier than sometimes you let on. I'm just going to throw that out there. And I wonder, is that a stylistic thing? Is that a strategic thing? Am I totally off base?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: No. In many respects, you're correct. You have to be discussing and presenting things in a way that people would appreciate it and accept it. I mean, sometimes if you come out and you get this instinct that it's going to be this way and most of the times your instinct is right, mostly because you have a lot of experience, you've got to be careful that you don't get ahead of what the facts and the data are, because then people will think you're just winging it, you know, you're shooting from the hip.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You knew it seems that when this, this 15-day pause was first recommended that it was gonna have to be longer than that. If for no other reason that the data was going to catch up. Was the intent to sort of, let's slow-roll this, not let's not jar the country too much and let them accept it a bit more slowly?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Yeah. It was a combination of a couple of things, Sanjay, you're absolutely correct. I was totally convinced that we would have to go beyond that. But there were a lot of forces that were, you know, conflicting. You know, if you keep it going longer, there's a lot of economic issues. If you don't, you might be responsible for making things worse than they were. I put all the economic things off my table. I said, you know, I care about the health and the economy of the country, but my job is the health of the nation. So, what I did was instead of coming out and trying to get ahead of everybody and saying, \"I know now that 15 days from now we're gonna have to go longer.\" It was, \"It's going to happen. Let's discuss it in a way that it happens.\" And it worked. Because when we presented the information to the president, he was -- this is (Dr.) Deb Birx and I -- that we went and presented it to him, he was very receptive to it. I mean, the thought that there'd be a lot of pushback, \"Oh, no, no, no.\" And he said it. He said, you know, \"The most important thing is the health of the country.\" So, I mean, I don't like the idea that we're going to have to do it longer. But if it's got to be done, it's got to be done.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Does this feel especially strange for you?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Oh, yeah. It's so, it's just different. I mean, the intensity of it, the potential for, you know, the fight, you know, it really looks like an ongoing war. You know, the, the dynamics of the virus against our attempts to mitigate it. And it's just it's, it's really intense. You know, hopefully we'll get through this. But it's, it's tough-going, man. This is an unusual disease. I'm fascinated, Sanjay, by what I would call the pathogenesis. You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a life-support machine) and they're dead. I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, you and I are both medical professionals. We're bonded by that. And I have to say that maybe you heard the story of Dr. James Goodrich, a pediatric neurosurgeon who died of Covid. We don't know for sure how he contracted it. But I found it really challenging, Dr. Fauci, to see what our health care professionals are going through, what they're talking about in terms of the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and then having to go home and worried about infecting their families. How about you? How have you sort of worked through that in your own mind?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: I'm doing everything I possibly can. And I'm not alone. I'm not the only person. There are a lot of good people that are trying to do that to make absolutely certain that we don't get to that point where people are putting themselves into even greater danger than the situation, even when you're optimally prepared with PPEs and everything you need, you are still putting yourself in danger. I mean, we've got to make sure regardless of what it takes, I mean, pull out all the stops, which I think we're doing. To me, that is the absolute highest priority to protect the health workers who are putting their lives on the line every day.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: We've done a lot of reporting about masks and the advice, really, from the World Health Organization, from the CDC: Healthy people don't need them. If you're sick, you should be staying inside anyway. But if you have to go out, then you can wear a mask. China, they said, you know, basically everyone should wear a mask at least in Wuhan. Do you think that we should be wearing a mask? Not a medical mask -- we don't want to take away from health care providers -- but even a cloth mask or anything to reduce the likelihood that we might be spreading the virus?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: If you look back, this whole story of masks has been confounded and conflated with things that I think have created a little bit of confusion, because the issue is that if everybody wears a mask and you don't have enough masks, the health care workers who need them may not get it. But that has driven the conversation, I think, to an extreme, because it says, \"Well, you know, masks are not that effective in preventing you from infecting somebody else or infecting somebody else, affecting somebody else in their ability to infect you.\" It's not perfect, but I think this is one of those times where we need to relook at it because although it isn't a 100% protected, if you have enough masks that you don't take away from the people who really need them, i.e. the health care workers, I think we should seriously consider the pros and the cons of maybe modifying our stance on whether people should be wearing masks because something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Will you recommend it?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, from what I've seen, Sanjay, I think that if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them, I would lean towards it because, I mean, what harm can it do if you have enough masks?  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting. You know, many years ago when I was back in residency, we made a decision to not shave (patients') hair as much as possible when we were doing brain operations. And part of the thinking was it doesn't really make a difference, really, in terms of their recovery. It's either shaving their hair or not. But it was the way they felt, and we found that in our own small study that people who did not have their head shaved actually recovered more quickly. They were more likely to be out of bed the next day, up and about, whatever it might be. The optics of masks, how much of that concerns you? Does it make it look like we are a nation that is sick?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, that was part of the conversation. If everybody wears a mask, does that look like we're all frightened of each other? But, you know, the people in Asia have been doing that long before coronavirus, and it's become part of their culture. I mean, is it good? Is it bad? I think it's neither. It's neither good nor bad. They've just integrated that into their culture. And, you know, as I said, I cannot imagine it's doing harm and it might be doing some good.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, I have found myself at times toggling between bewilderment and anger sometimes, especially given that it does seem like so many things were done right at the beginning. But then wondering if that time wasn't spent well. We knew how many masks were gonna likely be needed. We knew how many ventilators based on the federal government's modeling. Were there missed opportunities, do you think?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know, it's complicated. I mean, obviously, there probably were some missed opportunities, but I don't think that's the prevailing theme here. You know, I go back years and years when we got involved in pandemic preparedness. You know, if you would have said to anybody, \"What we really need is tens and tens of thousands, not 12.5 thousand, but tens and tens and tens of thousands of ventilators,\" there would not have been a lot of support for that. I got to tell you, there would not have been. Or, \"We've got to mobilize the industry to make a billion masks.\" I mean, now when you look back, we say, \"Oh, my God, why didn't we do it? So that we can not only give the masks to every health care worker who needs it, but if we want to go out and even have everybody in the community put a mask on.\" I mean, looking back retrospectively, it would have been nice. But I remember back before all this happened. I mean, there was good preparedness, but it wasn't the kind of thing we wish we had now.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: We don't think of our health care system with that sort of redundancy, I guess. If anything, the number of hospital beds that we have in the country may be even lower now than it was a decade or two ago. We do have a lot of redundancy in areas like defense.  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Right.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Should we have this sort of redundancy? Isn't this a kind of defense and war as well?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Sanjay, you're asking the question and preaching to the choir here. I mean, this is what I've spent the last almost 40 years arguing: that even though it is very difficult to get support for something that hasn't happened yet, it will happen, and then you will be kicking yourself that you didn't do that. And I think you used the right word. I had not heard it before, but I'm going to start using it now and that is \"redundancy.\" You're absolutely correct. There was very little redundancy to face a challenge like this. It's almost like you get one shot at it. If you don't knock it down, you run out (of) ammunition. You can't run out of ammunition. You can't run out of ammunition.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You think we've learned that lesson? Do you think it will be applied in the future?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Oh, I hope so, Sanjay. I mean, you know, when this is over -- and it will be over -- I think what we need to do is, is not just do a \"lessons learned\" paper that you write and stick in a drawer but really shake ourselves by the collars and say, \"Whoa, you know, look what we just went through. This cannot happen again.\"  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Is there something about this particularly that concerns you the most? That keeps you awake at night?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Yeah. What I'm concerned about is we don't know the full impact of its ability to infect. You know there are probably a lot of people who are infected who we don't know, who are asymptomatic. I'm concerned about if this circles out into the developing world. I mean, Africa could be a disaster. Certain parts of the developing world of Asia could be a disaster. Caribbean, some parts of South America. So, we're in a developed world now. You're seeing China, USA, Europe. I'm looking about what might happen the rest of the world. That's very troublesome.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: I have three daughters, I think as, as you know. And do you have three daughters as well?   <br><br>Dr. Fauci: I do, Sanjay. I have three daughters. Yes.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: That's another way we are connected here. But my daughters, you know, I've been thinking about them a lot and, and sort of imagine that this this event, what is happening right now with this coronavirus, is going to have a lifelong impact on them, not necessarily physically but I think in terms of how they see the world and the way that they act. How much of an impact do you think this is going to leave even after the pandemic is gone?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: I think it's going to be profound, Sanjay. I really do. I could hear it in the inflections in my daughters' voices when I speak with them on the phone. This is going to be imprinted on the personality of our nation for a very long time. I think this is going to be something that will be with them and have some impact, subconsciously or otherwise, for a very long time in their lives.   <br><br>Dr. Gupta: Do you think that when we get the all-clear, for lack of a better way of describing it, that it's going to feel like it's all clear, or are people still going to be frightened, do you think, to push the elevator button, to shake a hand, to do whatever?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Well, I actually think, I'm not a psychiatrist, so I don't want to go into that realm, but I think that when we do get the all clear, in some respects, there'll be relief, but I think there's going to be some subliminal post-traumatic stress syndrome that we're all going to face.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: You know, when you go out for a run with your wife at night, people probably don't stop you because they know they should keep their distance and you're running pretty fast. But if people stop you and ask you for your best advice, given all that's going on, Dr. Fauci, what do you tell them?  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: You know what I tell them, and actually, interesting you should ask that, because that happened last night as I was, was running with my wife. Someone did stop and I said, you know, hang in there. This is really a painful, difficult time for our nation. But we're a strong nation and we've been through things in our history that is worse than this. And yet we've come through. There's going to be an end to this. You know, we're in the middle of it, but there will be an end so hang in there and pull together. And that's what we need to each of us need to tell everybody that. That's how we talk to each other. <br><br>Dr. Gupta: I really admire you, Dr. Fauci. I really appreciate your service. I've tried to say that every time I get a chance to speak to you and I really mean it. You've instructed the world on this. You've instructed me, personally. And I think besides your scientific knowledge, you set an incredible, steady example. And I thank you for that.  <br><br>Dr. Fauci: Well, thank you, Sanjay. It's been great being with you today, but it's been a really, really great experience being your friend and colleague over the last couple of decades or more.  <br><br>Dr. Gupta: That's Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor.   <br><br>As you heard him say, the best thing we can all do at the moment is hang in there.   <br><br>We will get through this, and we'll get through this together.  <br><br>We'll be back tomorrow.

An explainer", "content": "Coronavirus. Just the word strikes fear into our hearts.  <br><br>\"Novel coronavirus\" is the proper term for this brand-new virus wreaking havoc on our unprepared world.  <br><br>But you can also call this nasty villain by its scientific name: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2 for short. <br><br>Becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 can trigger a potentially deadly respiratory disease called Covid-19, an illness which presents with three main acute symptoms: fever, a deep, dry cough and a shortness of breath which can become quickly life-threatening. Other symptoms can mimic a cold or the flu. <br><br>Covid-19 seems to strike the elderly and immunocompromised the hardest, along with any of us with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart and lung disease. But the young shouldn't take anything for granted -- there have been numerous deaths among people aged 20 to 50, as well as a very few among children.  <br><br>Covid-19 can also present with mild symptoms very similar to a typical cold or flu -- or no symptoms at all, which makes controlling the spread of the virus causing Covid-19 very difficult. <br><br>What is a coronavirus? <br><br>All viruses are like zombies -- they try to take over people's bodies -- but they aren't really alive. Outside the host's body they are dormant, surviving without living. Once touched or inhaled and brought inside, their ancient machinery springs into action, using proteins to latch onto and invade human cells.  <br><br>There they set up shop, producing millions of copies of themselves and causing those cells to rupture. Like the famous scene from the movie \"Alien,\" the viral offspring shoot out into the bloodstream, with the goal of invading more and more cells.  <br><br>As they multiply, humans began to spit them out into the universe with each exhalation, making us contagious days before we begin to cough, sneeze or have diarrhea -- all symptoms the virus creates to ensure it can leap from human to human, thus ensuring its survival. <br><br>This \"virus zombie invasion\" comes in all sort of shapes, sizes and genetic strategies. All coronaviruses are covered with pointy spires of protein, giving them the appearance of having a crown or \"corona\" -- hence the name. Coronaviruses use these spikes to latch onto and pierce our cells. <br><br>Coronaviruses are part of the RNA brigade of viruses, which are much less stable than their DNA-based comrades. Why is that important? Because instability leads to mistakes in copying genetic code. <br><br>That leads to mutations --  thousands, millions, billions of mutations. Sooner or later, one mutation hits pay dirt and allows the virus to cross the great divide between different species. A few million/billion/trillion more mistakes creates another mutation that allows that virus to spread easily. Now the virus is both in its new host and it is contagious. <br><br>It's that type of mutation which gives humanity viruses like SARS-CoV-2. <br><br>Where did the novel coronavirus come from? <br><br>The animal kingdom is teeming with coronaviruses. They are found in cats and dogs, pigs and cattle, turkey and chickens, mice, rats, rabbits and of course, humans. Insects too. <br><br>Some of those coronviruses can cross species, such as between pigs, cats and dogs, but for the most part coronaviruses stay loyal to their original hosts. Until, of course, they become that lucky mutation. <br><br>\"Usually viruses from one animal really don't effectively transmit to other animal species or even to people,\"  said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. <br><br>\"So usually if a virus goes from an animal to a human, it's sort of dead end. That person gets sick but it doesn't spread further,\" said Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.  <br><br>Besides the newly hatched novel coronavirus, there are actually six additional coronaviruses that infect humans -- four of them cause the common cold.  <br><br>Two more can be deadly. MERS-CoV is the villian behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which has killed over 800 people worldwide since it first appeared in 2012.  <br><br>SARS-CoV causes a serious form of pneumonia that can also be life-threatening. Globally, it killed 774 people between 2002 and 2004. No other cases have been reported worldwide since. {To put that into context, the death toll of the novel coronavirus since it burst on the scene in December is approaching 40,000). <br><br>The coronaviruses that cause MERS and SARS are though to have crossed from mammals to humans, where they mutated to become contagious. MERS-CoV first appeared in Jordon and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and it's thought to have crossed over to humans from dromedary camels in Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia. <br><br>\"MERS is extremely deadly, about 30% of people who are infected with MERS will die,\" Williams said.  \"So the virus got over one of the barriers -- it's able to infect humans, grow in them and cause disease -- but thankfully it really doesn't spread well person to person, other than very, very close contacts.\"  <br><br>SARS has been more difficult to pin down.  <br><br>Because one of the most common carriers for coronaviruses are bats, it's thought that the virus may have started there. Then it supposedly mutated to the masked palm civet, a small cat-like mammal eaten in some parts of China. But even that theory is disputed. <br><br>\"SARS caused death in about 10% of people that became infected and it did spread person to person but not super effectively,\" Williams said. \"There weren't many people walking around without symptoms or with mild symptoms, who could be spreading it. <br><br>\"This new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has overcome more barriers,\" Williams added. \"It spreads easily person to person and a lot of people can have either mild disease or they might not even have symptoms, yet they can have the virus and spread it.\" <br><br>The novel coronavirus appears to have originated in bats. A study published in February found the coronavirus found in bats shared 96% of the same genetic makeup as the novel coronavirus. But it wasn't a direct link, so the bat had to have infected another species, which then infected humans.  <br><br>Early reports pointed to snakes bought at a \"wet market\" in China were people buy live animals to eat. A recent report of the initial cases of coronavirus in China debunks the \"snake flu\" theory, reporting that in 13 of the 41 early cases the infected patients had no link to the wet market.  <br><br>A recent hypothesis claimed the intermediate host was the pangolin, an endangered scaly, ant-eating creature beloved for its meat and scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. But critics have been skeptical, sending genetic scientists back to their labs to continue the search. <br><br>At this time, scientists don't know where the novel coronavirus began. <br><br>\"These things are more difficult than [identifying] dinosaurs, because there's no fossil record of a virus,\" Williams said. \"For example, the main virus I study, human metapneumovirus, is clearly a virus that has circulated in humans for decades if not a few centuries.  <br><br>\"However, when you look at the genetics of the virus, its closest genetic relative is a bird virus,\" he added. \"So, did that virus jump to humans way back and become established? That's what we think. But it isn't impossible that a human virus jumped to birds and became established there.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "125", "title": "A real life 'Contagion': Humans may be to blame for viruses jumping from animals to us"}, {"id": "135", "title": "How did coronavirus break out?

Her goal: to understand how pancreatic cancer cells grow. And the pursuit of that goal requires a daily presence, not only to run experiments and analyze results but to simply ensure that the mice and cells are cared for and maintained. <br><br>But with Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, proliferating throughout the US, these are not normal days. While there is a tremendous effort underway to understand and develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, scientists such as LaRue -- who do vital research to further our understanding of biology, pathology, evolution, insect flight and countless other fields -- are forced to stay home. And only time will tell what affect this will have on scientific progress in the US. <br><br>In parts of the country, like New York, state-wide mandates aimed at limiting the risk of contagion now prevent all non-essential workers from entering their labs. In other areas, many institutions are setting their own regulations to this effect; the National Institutes of Health has moved all \"non-mission-critical laboratory operations\" to maintenance mode. With the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide topping 788,500, and more than 160,700 in the US, these measures are necessary. Yet they also leave labs with few essential personnel to preserve mice of critical genetic lineages (or \"strains\") and crucial research resources -- and no one to progress most of the ongoing experiments. <br><br>Researchers such as LaRue, who has been out of the lab for more than two weeks, are growing worried about the consequences of halting their studies, particularly those utilizing animals that can be costly and time-intensive to genetically engineer or breed. Even if the necessary animal strains survive the shutdown, experiments that are time- and condition-sensitive could still be greatly set back or ruined altogether.  <br><br>A mouse study, for instance, may require a large sample size of animals of a certain age from a specific mouse strain. Researchers might have had the foresight to freeze embryos or sperm from these mice prior to their lab's shutdown to make sure that the strain survives, but it can take months, if not years, to get a large enough sample size of mice at a specific age for a robust preclinical trial. And if those mouse strains were to be lost entirely, it would mean a lot of time -- not to mention thousands of dollars' worth of mouse maintenance -- down the drain. <br><br> Setbacks in animal research could also have tremendous downstream effects on our ability to understand and treat human pathologies. Discoveries made in animal models can often serve as fuel for human drug development. This is the case for LaRue's lab, which focuses on drug target discovery. Her lab's goal is to publish academic papers that show potential drug targets for pancreatic cancer therapies.  <br><br>\"[Drug companies] really utilize the scientific literature, and most of the literature is coming out of big academic labs,\" said LaRue. \"If academic labs are shut down for months and research continuities are disrupted, it's going to take several more months to gain momentum again and people won't be producing results for some time ... That could really put a lag on the drug discovery pipeline that we have going with industry.\" <br><br>And while researchers are sitting at home, writing up manuscripts or planning out future experiments, they must do so without the spontaneous, collaborative brainstorming that inspires creativity and facilitates troubleshooting. \"Our day-to-day is based on interactions with others ... bouncing ideas off of other people in a way that's difficult to do when we're all working remotely,\" said LaRue.  <br><br>Once labs have re-opened, experiments resume and social distancing is a distant memory -- one final uncertainty could still present an additional hurdle for the scientific community: research funding. As the economic reality of this pandemic sets in and funds are reallocated to relief programs to get the country up and running again, will there be any left for scientific grants?  <br><br>\"That's my greatest fear. What's going to happen at large to the finances in our society?\" said Brian Schutte, an associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Michigan State University, whose research centers on identifying genetic factors associated with cleft lip and palate. His lab uses mice, too, in this case to study the mechanism that causes the birth defect. But with a capable team of essential personnel staffed during his lab's shutdown to maintain the mouse colonies, Schutte is confident that his research can rebound if the lab re-opens within a couple of months. <br><br>Funding, however, or a lack thereof, may indeed pose a greater threat to Schutte's lab and countless others across the country that are supported by government-sponsored grants. Though industry, state and local budgets, as well as universities themselves, play a role in funding research, institutions still rely on federal grants to support their vast research portfolios. If future funding dwindles in the wake of the pandemic, projects already hindered by costly delays will face an uphill battle to be completed while new projects struggle to get off the ground.  <br><br>Addressing the immediate concerns from the scientific community, the Office of Management and Budget issued a directive this month revising grant requirements and allowing researchers some flexibility while their labs remain shuttered. But as the memorandum notes, \"Many of the operational impacts and costs are unknowable at this point, as they will depend on the spread of the coronavirus and response dictated by public health needs.\"  <br><br>A pandemic is, in many ways, like a natural disaster: Once it strikes, we can try to take precautions and preserve what we can, but we won't know the extent of the casualties until the dust has settled. Not until we are able to take stock of the post-Covid-19 world will we be able to assess the scope of the damage. Certainly, we will mourn the loss of life and bemoan the economic fallout. And we may also lament the stymieing of scientific progress. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "146", "title": "Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists"}, {"id": "52", "title": "A safer way to get America back to work"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}]}, "166": {"title": "This nurse used to read her children bedtime stories.

Visiting patients in their homes is a key part of her job, bringing her into close contact with them and their relatives. <br><br>\"As health professionals, we will all say to you: We know we are going to get Covid-19 at some point.

The need for healthcare workers like her to live away from their families has been recognized by the UK's National Health Service, which has promised to refund the money staff who are forced to move out of their homes during the Covid-19 outbreak have to pay for accommodation.  <br><br>But the cost has been more than financial. <br><br>A new normal <br><br>Stewart's ex-husband, Rob, who is now caring for the children day-to-day, says that -- outwardly at least -- they are dealing well with their new normal. <br><br>\"They sort of just brush everything off, don't they?\" he explains. \"I see it very much as a period of making the children more resilient for the future.\" <br><br>\"They play, they mess around,\" says Stewart. \"They seem to be pretty resilient, pretty versatile, flexible.\"  <br><br>Even so, she and Rob are keenly aware that the enforced separation, coupled with the confusion of life under a pandemic, may be affecting their children more profoundly.  <br><br>A Chinese study published in the British medical journal The Lancet highlighted the increased potential for children separated from their caregivers by the Covid-19 outbreak to develop mental health problems. It found that 30% of children quarantined or isolated away from their caregivers met the clinical criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). <br><br>Professor Tovah Klein, director of the Center for Toddler Development at New York's Barnard College, says children can blame themselves for their parent's absence. <br><br>That's a familiar concern for Laura Woods, a consultant nurse working in forensic mental health in a prison in the south of England. A single parent, she moved her son 200 miles away overnight, sending him to stay with her sister in north Wales. <br><br>\"My worst fear is that he will feel abandoned,\" she says. \"So, I remind him every day that I'm here and I'm thinking all the time of when I can come and get him. I think he also recognizes that it's not me kind of pushing him away ... you know, everything's out of our control.\" <br><br>For Stewart's children, her job itself is the root of much of their anxiety.  <br><br>\"My work has become life-threatening to me, and the children are facing a reality that mommy is in danger now,\" she explains. <br><br>\"I think that there will always be an element of uncertainty and worry about [their] mother's health now,\" she said. \"Before, there was a naivete, which was lovely for them.\" <br><br>Parents: The ultimate protection <br><br>Nim Tottenham, professor of psychology at Columbia University in New York, said that when children can be looked after by another parent or close relative, the risk of them finding the separation traumatic is much reduced. <br><br>\"Close family relationships are so important for infants and children, especially under times of stress, when the world is so strange as it is right now,\" she says. \"Parents can be a really effective buffer of children's emotions and stress.\"  <br><br>When a parent is living away from the rest of the family, it is particularly important to consider how to foster a sense of normalcy and reassurance, she says. <br><br>Drawing a parallel with military families, who frequently have to deal with separation and fears for a parent's safety, Tottenham says technology can be invaluable in maintaining a regular relationship. <br><br>The Stewarts' Easter Sunday video call is filled with chatter about the new routines and oddities that mark daily life. They pretend to throw Easter eggs to one another, and Kitty falls off her chair as she catches hers, making them all laugh.  <br><br>Before long, though, Casper asks when they'll be able to see each other in person. <br><br>It comes up every call, Stewart says. <br><br>\"I'm not sure at the moment,\" she answers truthfully, careful not to offer false hope. <br><br>\"Oh,\" he says slowly, his gaze slipping down off the screen. <br><br>\"We'll see how things get on,\" she says. \"We'll take each day as it comes.\" <br><br>Given the emotional fallout that such video calls cause, Stewart says she only video calls her children a few times a week at most. <br><br>The pain of separation <br><br>More accustomed to the noisy hubbub of family life, Stewart now wakes up to a silent house. She comes home to silence, cooks and eats in silence, and hurries out to work in the morning to avoid it. <br><br>As a nurse, she has always looked to her family for support, but for the first time in years she is facing the stresses of work alone.  <br><br>Normally, she would spend her evenings reading the children bedtime stories, but recently she's been writing essays to them in case she dies, pouring out on paper advice on how to best live their lives. <br><br>\"This underlying nag is that I'm not going to see them again,\" she says. \"That's my fear.\"  <br><br>She worries, too, over what the fatalism that has washed over her professional life will do to her children. She knows they can sense the difference in her. <br><br>\"I have this internal battle as a mother and a practitioner that I'm putting myself at risk to look after other people's families,\" she explains, \"When, actually, my children may lose their mother.\" <br><br>Tottenham, the psychologist, knows that guilt, isolation and fears for their children can be an overpowering mix for parents who are away from their families. <br><br>\"The same rules really apply whether you are three or 43,\" she says. \"Social support is probably one of the most important things in terms of our emotions and well-being right now.\"  <br><br>\"By the parent taking care of themselves emotionally, they are at the same time taking care of the young children,\" she adds <br><br>Tottenham recommends using a calendar to physically mark the approach of a reunion, helping both children and parents remember that their separation is temporary. <br><br>But in the UK, where the government has extended the lockdown for a further three weeks, with few clues as to when the country will be ready to reopen, such definitive countdowns are currently impossible. <br><br>It's this uncertainty that eats away at Stewart. <br><br>\"I've got Easter eggs here. I can't give them. I don't know why I bought them, actually, but I just went crazy ... It's normality, isn't it?\" <br><br>Even if the timing of her longed-for reunion with Kitty and Casper is still uncertain, for Lucy, there's one thing she's looking forward to above all else. <br><br>\"I'd just like to go for a walk with my children. In the sunshine, holding hands,\" she says, struggling to hold back tears. \"Three shadows, not one.\" <br><br>\"Three shadows.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "196", "title": "90% of the world's students are in lockdown.

But at what cost?", "content": "Dozens of actors and film crew members crammed into a small hair salon in an upscale Cairo neighborhood in early April. They were racing to finish filming a TV serial scheduled to premiere during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts next week. <br><br>The narrow streets of the Egyptian capital were a beehive of activity with \u200bdozens of crew members moving up and down the road or resting on plastic chairs on the sidewalks. \u200b <br><br>In previous years, the crowd, the six trucks and 32 vehicles lining the surrounding streets would have attracted passers-by hoping to see their favorite film stars. It is a common sight in the weeks before Ramadan, a high season for TV, when crews work 16-20 hour days to meet their deadlines. <br><br>But at a time when Egypt is observing a partial curfew to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, concerned neighbors were alarmed to see a big crowd ignoring social distancing guidelines and called the police. That day officers showed up to the set seven times but everything they were doing was perfectly legal, Ahmed Yehia, a producer working on the serial, told CNN.  <br><br>Yehia works on a comedy, but his experience is representative of the Egyptian pre-Ramadan film industry.  <br><br>Egypt's government advises against activities involving crowds and only imposes fines on those violating the \u200bcurfew, which was 7pm-6am initially. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who promised cash handouts to \u200bworkers impacted by the virus, said in a televised speech last week that he did not want to completely \"suspend \u200bwork completely in all sectors.\"  <br><br>Since the start of the outbreak, the government has suspended schools and universities, grounded most flights and closed mosques and churches in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. It advised those who can to work from home, but encouraged production in different industries to continue, including TV which is mostly controlled by privately owned companies with ties to the state. <br><br>Insiders in the multi-million dollar TV industry warned that continuing to work in crowded sets over long hours could be deadly. \u200b <br><br>\"How can we make a living if we and our loved ones are dead?\" script writer Mariam Naoum said in a public appeal \u200bon Facebook to stop productions on March 22. By that date, the virus had \u200bofficially claimed 14 lives, including two military generals, and the country's confirmed cases stood at 327. TV channels were pressuring producers, who were pressuring actors to continue filming, Naoum said. <br><br>Though she was able to work from home as a scriptwriter, she felt she was facilitating the work that was happening on those crowded sets, she added: \"I feel that with every scene I [write and] send, I hurt people that I love very much.\" <br><br>'Ramadan is our Super Bowl' <br><br>Millions in Egypt and around the Arab world will be glued to the high-production period dramas and thrillers throughout the holy month of Ramadan, which begins on April 23. <br><br>Discussions of plot twists dominate the traditional family gatherings after the day-long fast. In good years, Egypt can produce up to 80 serials for that month alone, shown on local and \u200binternational Arab channels selling ad slots to corporations splurging on big stars and expensive productions. \"Ramadan is our Super Bowl,\" film director Tamer Mahdy said about the ad industry. <br><br>This struggle between protecting people from the virus without bringing the economy to a screeching halt is mirrored globally, in everything from government responses to people's daily choices. <br><br>Egypt has a population of \u200bnearly 100 million people living in densely populated cities and villages. Its fragile health care sector is reeling under budget cuts and its political leadership \u200bis widely perceived to lack transparency, and flout its own rules. \u200b <br><br>A third of the population lives in poverty and at least half of the economy is made up of workers who depend on daily wages for survival  <br><br>\"There is no protective gear. And that's why doctors are at high risk,\" Dr. Mohammed Hassan, \u200ba physician and former Egypt's doctors' union leader told CNN. \u200bBut for a population the size of Egypt's, experts worry about the country's capacity, with just 346 ventilators set aside to treat coronavirus patients. <br><br>Health and government officials didn't respond to multiple CNN requests for comment over the span of a week. \u200b <br><br>Egypt's Minister of Health, Hala Zayed, has repeatedly cited Egypt's low number of confirmed cases as a point of pride for the Egyptian government. Egypt reported 2,505 cases and 183 deaths as of Wednesday and the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended its early interventions to contain the virus.  <br><br>But experts warn that the health sector is ill-equipped to handle an outbreak like the one seen in Europe\u200b, and equipment shortages are affecting hospitals across the country. \"We managed to collect donations and buy the basic medical supplies,\" a cardiologist at a public hospital told CNN. \"The health ministry is doing its best,\" but \"a corrupt and poor system\" can't be reformed during a pandemic, she added. The cardiologist spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid punitive measures. <br><br>At least three doctors \u200bhave died from the novel coronavirus and 43 others health workers \u200bhave tested positive, the doctors' syndicate said, leading to partial closures of public hospitals offering free healthcare to thousands of the most vulnerable\u200b. One of the hospitals that has had to reduce its capacity is the National Cancer Institute. \u200bThe WHO said 13 percent of Egypt's confirmed cases are healthcare workers.   <br><br>And even where the capacity still exists, some patients say they don't feel safe. Seeing how some doctors and nurses didn't use basic protective gear or observe social distancing at a public hospital, cancer patient Amr Asaad told CNN he is \"reluctant to resume his chemotherapy.\"  <br><br>Stopping is not an option <br><br>\"Postponing or not shooting is not an option,\" said Mohammed Gamaleddine, a line producer in an upcoming Ramadan drama, told CNN. \"We are freelancers, not rich stars. There are hundreds of people who work in this industry and most of us may stay at home with no job or money from year to year. It could be the only gig we have,\" he added.  <br><br>Despite these appeals and the concerns expressed by crews and actors, shooting only stopped on productions that were so behind in their schedule that they would not have been able to meet their deadlines while working under the curfew\u200b, according to several industry insiders who spoke to CNN. \u200bThose who had finished 70% of filming \u200bacquired permits to work through the curfew, scaled down the production, halved the number of crews on newly sterilized sets and brought physicians on site\u200b, they said. <br><br>Ashraf Zaki, the head of the semi-official actors' syndicate said in early April only 25% of the planned serials would make it to the screens in Ramadan. <br><br>\"The government wants us to finish the series, so people can find something to entertain them during the lockdown. The production company will pay a huge fine [to TV networks] if they don't deliver before Ramadan,\" Yehia, the producer who worked on the shoot at the hair salon, told CNN. <br><br>A week later, Yehia's crew moved to a hotel to film a number of other scenes. A shoot at the hotel reception involved 130 people. The following scene was shot in a hotel room, with a minimum of 20 people \"after cutting down all unnecessary staff,\" he explained. To cut costs, by paying the hotel for one day instead of two, the crew kept on working for 20 hours -- a common practice in the annual race. <br><br>\"Right now, I am wearing a mask and gloves, but in a couple of hours -- like every day -- I will get too busy or get tired and will throw them away,\" Yehia told CNN on the phone from the hotel. \"We are all crammed in one place. There is no way we can have social distancing.\u200b\" <br><br> \"We all would rather be at home with our families. I am so scared for my family. I agreed with my wife that the kids will be safer in our hometown Alexandria and I haven't seen them or my mother for the past three weeks,\" Yehia added. <br><br>\u200b\u200b <br><br>Lina Wardani reported from Cairo.

Many children are \"at the mercy of killer diseases,\" UNICEF said. <br><br>\"Our greatest fear remains the damage this coronavirus could do in a country like DRC,\" said WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom. \"Even as the flames of one outbreak begin to die down, we are fighting another fire front.\" <br><br>\"As for the COVID-19 pandemic, we are worried, of course, but we hope that, if people stick to the government guidelines, and we are able to communicate those guidelines to the community, the outbreak will not spread,\" said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, who heads the WHO Ebola vaccination program in DRC.   <br><br>Nearly 350 cases of coronavirus and at least 25 deaths have so far been officially reported in the country, as of April 22, according to Johns Hopkins University \u2014 still relatively low numbers compared to other parts of the world.  <br><br>That leaves a \"window of opportunity\" for medical teams to prepare and prevent higher numbers, Mihigo said. Currently, the majority of cases are focused in the capital Kinshasa, where authorities have implemented preventive measures, but social distancing in the densely populated city has proven difficult, he said. <br><br>'Competition for resources'  <br><br>Fighting several outbreaks at the same time also creates a \"competition for resources,\" where increased attention to fight one disease leaves gaps in the efforts to fight another, Mihigo said.  <br><br>For example, when international attention was focused on the fight against Ebola in 2018, the measles campaign experienced a big setback in funding for an extended period, which resulted in an \"explosion of cases,\" Mihigo said. WHO described the DRC outbreak as \"the world's worst measles epidemic.\"  <br><br>Since 2019, over 330,000 suspected measles cases have been reported and over 6,200 people have died, at least 5,300 of them children, according to the UN. <br><br>Malaria, another preventable disease, infected approximately 16.5 million people in the DRC in 2019, causing nearly 17,000 deaths, according to the UN.  <br><br>Ebola has killed more than 2,200 people in the country and infected 3,400 since the beginning of the outbreak in August, 2018, mostly focused in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The country was just days away from declaring an end to that outbreak but several new cases have since reemerged.  <br><br>Medical teams are also trying to halt the spread of cholera in the southern parts of the country through vaccination and strengthening water sanitation measures, Mihigo said. Nearly 31,000 cases of cholera were reported in 2019 and 540 deaths, according to the UN.  <br><br>In the meantime, preventive efforts to fight polio and yellow fever had to be put on hold, as the country prepares for the fight against coronavirus. \"That explains why we are in a situation almost like a protracted sort of situation where multiple outbreaks break at the same time,\" Mihigo said.  <br><br>\"The supply system is also an issue, because you need to bring in all the vaccines - being for measles, being for yellow fever or cholera - and it's not easy to manage all the logistics for all these events happening at the same time,\" he said. \"This is probably the reality check that we are having on the ground.\"  <br><br>\"Unless health facilities have the means to deliver immunization, nutrition and other essential services, including in remote areas of the country, we risk seeing the lives and futures of many Congolese children scarred or destroyed by preventable diseases,\" said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF representative in DRC.  <br><br>Lessons learned are helping fight coronavirus  <br><br>However, despite the setbacks, lessons learned from the fight with those multiple outbreaks and the systems that were implemented are already helping efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus, Mihigo said.  <br><br>\"During Ebola we lost many health workers to that disease, so the country has learned a great deal of how to put in place strict infection-prevention control measures,\" Mihigo said. \"I think this will be something quite beneficial in the fight of corona.\" <br><br>Mihigo said the current environment is also different as people understand they are facing a global pandemic and therefore communities are more likely to adopt the recommended preventive measures.  <br><br>\"Now people know that this is not something that is only in their country, they are seeing the news, they are seeing how literally all countries on the planet are being affected,\" Mihigo said. \"So people understand that this is a real threat.\" <br><br>The Geographic Information System (GIS) that was implemented for polio surveillance could also be used as a tool in the fight with coronavirus, he said.  <br><br>Some of the coronavirus prevention measures that the government has implemented, such as limited circulation between provinces, temporary border closures and limiting international flights, are also helping, Mihigo said.  <br><br>\"The-Covid-19 pandemic requires all of us to work together. It really requires a multi-sectoral, all-of-society approach and we can only succeed if we put all of our work together,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, on April 9.  <br><br>Vulnerable \"hardest hit\" <br><br>Nearly 3.3 million children in the DRC have \"unmet vital health needs\" and 9.1 million children, or nearly one in five under the age of 18, require humanitarian assistance, according to the latest UNICEF estimates.  <br><br>Furthermore, ongoing militia violence in the northeast, including attacks against health centers, have claimed the lives of residents and health workers. Nearly a million people were forced to flee their homes in 2019 alone, the UN agency said, making access to medical care and prevention even more difficult <br><br>In addition, authorities warn the virus could also \"unleash economic and social devastation\" and lead to a food security crisis caused by disrupted agricultural production and food imports. <br><br>The World Bank projects sub-Saharan Africa will suffer its first recession in 25 years, as economic growth is forecast to fall sharply in 2020 because of coronavirus.  <br><br>\"All countries must rapidly accelerate and scale up a comprehensive response to the pandemic, including an appropriate combination of proven public health and physical distancing measures,\" said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. <br><br>\"Africa still has an opportunity to reduce and slow down disease transmission,\" he said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "107", "title": "Fauci says coronavirus hospitalizations are dropping because social distancing is working "}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

In the weeks that followed, case numbers spiked and from January 23 until April 8, residents were unable to leave the city as the Chinese government attempted to contain the outbreak.  <br><br>But despite the attempts to halt the spread of the virus, it has now infected more than 2.6 million people worldwide. <br><br>In Wuhan though, the outbreak now appears to be largely under control, with no new cases or deaths reported in Hubei province as of the latest figures released Wednesday. <br><br>Streets that only a few weeks ago were cordoned off behind police checkpoints are now open to traffic, while some public spaces such as the Wuhan Zoo are preparing to allow people back inside. <br><br>But that doesn't mean people are letting their guard down or all the restrictions have lifted. Walking down the street, almost everyone continues to practice social distancing, keeping at least 1.5 meters (five feet) apart.  <br><br>Many stores, including major chains such as Starbucks, have moved their goods and services out onto the sidewalk to avoid the need for customers to congregate inside. <br><br>Mr Xu, a local business owner, whose convenience store is set up across from a Wuhan convention center, said since he reopened in April there had been very few customers. \"The situation now is not very optimistic. Even after businesses reopened, there are not many people. I'm a bit worried about this,\" he said.  <br><br>\"I don't know when (my business) can recover.\" <br><br>Slow recovery <br><br>To date, there have been 68,128 reported cases of the novel coronavirus in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, claiming the lives of 4,512 people.  <br><br>A sprawling metropolis, Wuhan is one of China's largest industrial and transport hubs, located on the banks of the Yangtze River. It has long been considered the economic engine of the country's central heartland. <br><br>The decision on January 23 to effectively seal off the city, closing all transport links, was without precedent. Slowly the restrictions became more strict, eventually banning citizens from making any non-essential trips out of their apartments. <br><br>Checkpoints were set up across the city to stop people leaving their homes, apart from short trips for medicine and groceries. <br><br>Some of these conditions are now familiar to millions of people across Asia, North America and Europe who have since been requested, or ordered, to stay at home to help stop the spread of Covid-19. <br><br>But just as Wuhan's lockdown predicted the path for hundreds of cities around the world, its reopening also offers a window into the difficult path ahead. <br><br>In the first quarter of the year alone, Hubei's economy shrank by almost 40%, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. <br><br>Some stores are now open and people are returning to public places, with mask-wearing Wuhan residents taking to the city's parks to go for walks, play badminton and even get haircuts courtesy of outdoor barbers. <br><br>But there is nothing of the packed bustle which once-characterized Wuhan.  <br><br>For every opened shopfront, there is another one shuttered. More than two weeks after the lockdown ended, restaurants still are only allowed to sell takeaway food while gyms remain closed. <br><br>On the streets, some citizens are still going outside in full protective gear, including plastic hazardous environment suits. When serving customers, some store owners not only wear face masks but also gloves. <br><br>Checking into their hotel, the CNN team were required to give their travel history and had their temperature taken, before being sprayed down with disinfectant by the hotel workers. In the elevator a tissue was provided to press the button. <br><br>One local driver told CNN that his private car hire business has been slow to recover since restrictions to leave the city eased on April 8.  <br><br>\"I've only had two passengers in two weeks,\" he said, asking we not use his name out of a growing concern for repercussions in speaking with foreign media. <br><br>Prior to the outbreak, he said he drove at least a dozen passengers a day, including many foreign diplomatic staff. But as the outbreak worsens, most countries have closed their consulates in Wuhan and evacuated their personnel. None have returned yet. <br><br>\"Post lockdown I've spent as much time enjoying nature and the outdoors with with my family,\" the driver said, indicating a large hiking backpack sitting in his trunk. \"We avoid crowds at the local parks. Instead we drive farther out.\" <br><br>Waiting for the second wave <br><br>US citizen Christopher Suzanne, who has been living in Wuhan for at least 10 years with his Chinese wife, was in the US for his new baby's baptism when the coronavirus hit the city. <br><br>Desperate to get back to look after his wife's parents, the family made the decision to return to Wuhan on March 30, after being granted permission to renter the city.  <br><br>With his family now back in the place he considers home, Suzanne said he was happy to see the people of Wuhan  out on the streets and enjoying the spring sunshine. <br><br>\"It makes me happy but I don't want to see people get complacent. We are afraid that there is going to be a second wave,\" he said. <br><br>Concerns over a so-called second wave have risen recently in China, as a jump in imported cases especially from Russia has led to the country's highest number of new infections in weeks. These fears have been aided by a rise in asymptomatic cases as well. <br><br>China has changed its case definition for Covid-19 several times. On March 31, it decided to begin reporting the number of asymptomatic cases in the country after weeks of keeping the number confidential. <br><br>As of Wednesday, there were just under 1,000 asymptomatic cases under observation in China, according to the National Health Commission. <br><br>Suzanne said that he believed a second wave of infections in the city was inevitable, as people begin to go outside again and potentially mingle with asymptomatic cases. <br><br>\"To be able to go outside was just that explosion of excitement but then you have that fear of can I go outside? Should I go outside? Is my family going to be okay if I go outside?\" he said.  <br><br>\"I hope it gets back to the way that it was. But I don't know if it's going to.\" <br><br>When asked about concerns that the Chinese government were withholding information on death tolls or the origins of the virus, Suzanne said he and many other locals were more concerned with keeping themselves and their loved ones safe. <br><br>\"Whether or not they want to share that information with the public doesn't concern me... I'm really concerned about my family and what we can do\" he said. <br><br>CNN's Nectar Gan contributed to this article. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "198", "title": "As Poland defies 'European values,' women resist on streets and online"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Asked if people should wear masks, he had a straightforward answer: \"No.\"  <br><br>Now he's not so sure. On Monday, Redfield said told NPR that the CDC was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection. It's likely only a matter of time before other mask holdouts, most prominently the World Health Organization (WHO), follow suit.  <br><br>Pivot to protection <br><br>Writing last month, Adrien Burch, an expert in microbiology at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that \"despite hearing that face masks 'don't work,' you probably haven't seen any strong evidence to support that claim. That's because it doesn't exist.\" <br><br>In fact, there is evidence of the exact opposite: that masks help prevent viral infections like the current pandemic.  <br><br>Burch pointed to a Cochrane Review -- a systemic analysis of published studies on a given topic -- which found strong evidence during the 2003 SARS epidemic in support of wearing masks. One study of community transmission in Beijing found that \"consistently wearing a mask in public was associated with a 70% reduction in the risk of catching SARS.\"  <br><br>SARS, like Covid-19, is a respiratory illnesses caused by the same family of viruses called coronavirus. <br><br>While SARS spread around the world, the worst of the epidemic was focused in Asia, particularly mainland China and Hong Kong. The legacy of this experience could be seen early on in the current pandemic, as news of a virus spreading led people across the region to don face masks to protect themselves.  <br><br>From the beginning, Hong Kong and many other Asian governments have recommended people wear masks in public, whether they are showing virus symptoms or not. <br><br>Despite eye-rolling in some parts of the Western press, and talk of Asia's \"obsession\" with face masks, the tactic appears to have contributed in helping to stem the outbreak.  <br><br>Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, all places with widespread mask use, have seen greater success in preventing major outbreaks or reining them in once they begin than in Europe and North America where masks are either not used or hard to come by.  <br><br>Speaking to CNN, Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, said that \"if you look at the data in Hong Kong, wearing a mask is probably the most important thing in terms of infection control.\" <br><br>\"And it not only brings down the cases of coronaviruses, it also brings down the influenza,\" he said. \"In fact, this is now the influenza season, and we hardly see any influenza cases. And that is because the masks actually protected not only against coronaviruses but also against the influenza viruses as well.\" <br><br>At the beginning of March, Hong Kong had only around 150 cases of the virus, despite being on the frontlines of the pandemic since it began and not instituting many of the more draconian population controls seen elsewhere. The city has only seen a spike recently after people began returning to the city from Europe and the US.  <br><br>\"Based on the research, face masks are much more likely to help than to hurt,\" according to Burch. \"Even if it's just a homemade cloth mask, if you wear it correctly and avoid touching it, the science suggests that it won't hurt you and will most likely reduce your exposure to the virus.\"  <br><br>Heightened contradictions <br><br>In its guidance on the coronavirus, the CDC notes that it spreads primarily \"through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneeze,\" which \"can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\"  <br><br>The agency recommends that people who are sick wear a face mask or otherwise attempt \"to cover your coughs and sneezes,\" while those caring for them should also wear a face mask whenever they are in the same room. <br><br>Yet, in the same advice, the CDC said that non-symptomatic \"do not need\" to wear face masks, adding that they \"may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.\"  <br><br>And this is what has been so frustrating and confusing for many people, particularly those who advocate for wearing face masks as a precaution. The CDC, along with the WHO and several other public health bodies and experts, has been simultaneously claiming that masks do not offer protection in ordinary circumstances, while stating they are necessary for health workers and caregivers.  <br><br>This conflicting advice helped create confusion and no small amount of hostility towards officials who people felt were lying to them and putting them at risk. There were numerous replies to Adams' tweet about masks in February asking \"why are masks good for healthcare workers but not for the public?\" <br><br>Writing last month in the New York Times, Zeynep Tufekci, a professor of information science, said that \"to help manage the shortage, the authorities sent a message that made them untrustworthy.\"  <br><br>\"Providing top-down guidance with such obvious contradictions backfires exactly because lack of trust is what fuels hoarding and misinformation,\" she said, adding that if officials were concerned about shortages, they should have stated this outright, and asked people to donate masks they had bought to hospitals, not claimed they were ineffective in the first place.  <br><br>\"When people feel as though they may not be getting the full truth from the authorities, snake-oil sellers and price gougers have an easier time.\"  <br><br>Masks work <br><br>Trying to avoid mask shortages for healthcare workers appears to have been the main priority of those arguing against widespread their widespread use. But while the motivation behind this may have been good, such advice may have actually helped spread the virus, thus adding to the number of patients overwhelming hospitals.  <br><br>One of the reasons the CDC's Redfield gave for potentially changing the guidance on masks is that the coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic, and therefore having everyone covering their faces -- as has been the norm in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia since January -- could help rein in transmission.  <br><br>That the virus is spread before people feel sick is not news, however. It's been widely supposed since the first weeks of the outbreak, and evidence has only grown stronger in recent months.  <br><br>And even if there was not asymptomatic transmission, universal or near universal mask wearing has its uses. As others have noted, instructing only the sick to wear masks is essentially asking people to put a sign on themselves inviting fear and hostility, whereas if everyone wears a mask when outside, the sick are more likely to do so, thus protecting people around them.  <br><br>The lack of masks and other protective equipment in hospitals across the US and other countries should be remedied as fast as possible. But these shortages were caused by policy failures and supply chain issues, not a sudden run on 75 cent paper masks by concerned members of the public.  <br><br>As the evidence increasingly comes round in favor of masks, we must ask how many infections might have been avoided if in January, instead of saying masks wouldn't help, officials and the media had instead lobbied for factories to ramp up domestic production, provided guidance on how to make masks at home, and asked other countries to donate surplus materials?  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "87", "title": "Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proof"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Some, but not all, also sell live animals. They are referred to as \"wet\" owing to the fact that floors are often hosed down after vendors wash vegetables or clean fish.  <br><br>Wet markets that sell live animals can risk creating the types of dangerous conditions where viruses can spread from animals to humans, due to the close quarters and potentially unsanitary practices -- especially, if they keep rare animals or those  captured from the wild, experts say.   <br><br>The 2003 SARS epidemic, for example, was linked to the sale of civet cats in Guangdong province.  <br><br>Most wet markets, however, are not virus petri-dishes filled with exotic animals ready to be slaughtered. <br><br>For a large proportion of people in China and across Asia, they are just places to go to buy fresh food, such as chicken, pork, fish and vegetables, at affordable prices. <br><br>Billion-dollar wildlife trade <br><br>Wet markets are a common sight not just in mainland China but across Asia.  <br><br>In Hong Kong, for example, there is a widespread network of wet markets where thousands of locals shop everyday for their meat and vegetables. There is one in almost every district and none of them trade in exotic or wild animals. <br><br>Similar markets can also be found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. <br><br>Some wet markets, however, can provide an outlet for the trade in exotic wildlife, which according to a 2017 Chinese government report was worth more than $73 billion.  <br><br>But the trade, while lucrative, is by no means mainstream. The consumption of wild meats is not common, especially in big cities, and consumers often have to travel to specific sites to purchase rare or exotic animals. <br><br>After SARS authorities in several provinces tried to tackle the wildlife trade, banning the sale of some animals such as civet cats and snakes, but many of the bans either weren't enforced or were quietly removed. <br><br>In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government temporarily banned the trade of wild animals for food in late February and is currently drafting a permanent law to further tighten controls. <br><br>According to Chinese state-run media Xinhua, at least 94% of mainland China's wet markets had been reopened as of March 22. It remains unclear, however, how many of those have completely stopped trading wild animals.  <br><br>\"In the face of Covid-19, it is understandable that around the world there are calls for shutting down all wet markets,\" said Duan Biggs, senior research fellow in the Environmental Futures Research Institute at Australia's Griffith University. <br><br>\"However, a complete ban is unlikely to be a sustainable solution to this risk -- as earlier failed attempts at bans and shutdowns show. Instead, new policies and regulations need to incorporate scientific evidence together with consideration of different cultural perceptions and values towards wildlife, wildlife trade and consumption.\" <br><br>Changing practices  <br><br>Traditionally, consumers in China have long favored fresh produce, preferring to make several trips to a market each week to buy meat, fish and vegetables, rather than driving to a supermarket for a weekly shop. But in recent years, like everywhere else globally, wet markets have lost ground to supermarkets, especially among younger consumers.  <br><br>Online grocery stores, backed by internet giants who have cash to burn and sophisticated logistics systems, are also gaining ground.  <br><br>Even older generations, who have a lifelong habit of shopping in wet markets, are being lured to new services such as Alibaba's Hema (Freshhippo) with generous discounts and pledges for safety and traceability of its produce. Hema alone had 197 storefronts in China by the end of 2019. <br><br>Travel restrictions during the virus have accelerated the trend away from wet markets. Online grocery stores become a daily necessity when people across China were locked down in their homes.  <br><br>Eliam Huang, analyst at Coresight, said the outbreak forces users to adapt to the trend otherwise they would be hesitant to do so. \"The crisis makes people more prepared for the techy future,\" she said. <br><br>But for now, discouraging people from using wet markets altogether is not a viable solution. University of Sydney's environmental and humanitarian engineer Petr Matous said that wet markets play an important role in food security for many low income communities, both in China and globally, who don't have access to online options. <br><br>\"Abolishing wet markets may give the illusion of solving the cause of the current situation but the real problems are deeper than that,\" he said in an email.  <br><br>Many experts agree that ending the illegal trade of animals is the most important means of preventing the next pandemic -- and that means better regulation and stricter enforcement, especially at a local level.  <br><br>In the long term, however, even better regulation might not fully stop the illegal wildlife trade if demand persists -- it will simply go underground, according to the World Wildlife Fund.  <br><br>\"This health crisis must serve as a wake-up call for the need to end unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, as exotic pets, for food consumption and for their perceived medicinal value,\" said the organization. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "196", "title": "90% of the world's students are in lockdown.

She said the company, which could not be reached for comment, decided to close the factory, leaving her without a source of income past March. <br><br>The coronavirus pandemic has led factories to furlough or lay off more than half of the country's nearly 4.1 million garment workers, according to estimates from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). Like Akther, most of them are women, and the roughly $110 they earn every month is often their families' only source of money. <br><br>\"My family runs on my single income,\" said Akther, who said she provides for her husband and child. \"I don't know how my family will survive.\" <br><br>Global lockdowns and unprecedented job losses have caused demand for just about anything that isn't food to evaporate, including clothing. That's led the international apparel brands and retailers who rely on the cheap labor that Bangladesh provides to cancel or suspend an estimated $3.17 billion worth of orders in the country, according to BGMEA. <br><br>The loss of business has exposed a rift between those major brands and the factory owners they contract with. Members of Bangladesh's business community say they've been left to pick up the tab, which has put their factories and workers in dire straits. <br><br>\"It's abysmal, it's unreal,\" said Rubana Huq, President of the BGMEA, adding that there is little legal recourse in the country for factories to demand that international retailers fulfill the terms of their contracts. \"I don't want any grant, I don't want any kind of charity, I just want the bare minimum justice for our workers.\" <br><br>The fallout is also devastating news for the South Asian country's economy, which is disproportionately reliant on the apparel industry to keep its economy humming. Garments make up roughly 80% of Bangladesh's exports, Trading Economics says, and generated more than $30 billion last year, according to the country's Export Promotion Bureau \u2014 making it the second biggest exporter of such goods in the world after China. In total, the industry contributes 16% of Bangladesh's GDP. <br><br>Millions of jobs at risk <br><br>The millions of factory workers aren't the only ones at risk, either. Around 15 million jobs in the country are reliant on the industry, directly or indirectly, according to the Bangladesh Commerce Ministry. That includes food sellers, truck drivers and port workers. <br><br>\"It's a very dangerous situation which may impact a lot of people,\" said Bangladesh Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi. <br><br>Sweeping government lockdowns have also separated some workers from their families, since many travel from smaller villages to Dhaka to find work. The capital and largest city in Bangladesh, which was locked down late last month, is where most of the country's garment factories are based. <br><br>\"The biggest problem right now is food, we don't know how we will eat,\" said Rezaul Islam, 26, who said he was laid off in late March from a Dhaka-based factory and is now stuck in the city. The nationwide lockdown, which has been extended until Saturday, forbids people from going out except to pick up groceries, medicine or other necessities. <br><br>\"We have families in our village who are dependent on us,\" Islam said. \"Whatever we earn here we send it back home. Now my family (will) have to live without eating.\" <br><br>A question of ethics <br><br>Islam called on the factories to pay their staff during the crisis. Wages are already low in the industry, which means many workers don't have a lot of savings to dip into now. <br><br>\"It's not fair to kick us out like this,\" Islam said. \"Either give us back our job or give us three months' salary.\" <br><br>Permanent workers who are terminated after having been with a company for at least a year are entitled to some pay for at least 60 days, according to Bangladeshi labor law. Islam says he was paid for a month. The factory where he worked, Saturn Textiles Ltd., could not be reached for comment. <br><br>But factory owners stress that they can't prop up their workers alone, particularly if the brands they work with aren't fulfilling the terms of their contracts. More than half of the 316 Bangladesh suppliers surveyed by Penn State University's Center for Global Workers' Rights said that most of their finished or in-process orders have been canceled since the pandemic began. The survey respondents' clients were mostly European and American brands. <br><br>The survey found that more than 98% of buyers refused to contribute to the partial wages of furloughed workers that the law requires. The buyers are contractually obliged to cover the total costs of the goods they ordered, including 16% for paying salaries, BGMEA says. The factories have to buy the raw materials and pay staffing and overheads before they are paid by the brands and retailers, Rubana Huq says, meaning all the business risk is taken on at their end. <br><br>Upholding those contracts is the ethical thing to do, said David Hasanat, the chairman of Viyellatex Group, which has six factories in Dhaka. <br><br>After a garment factory collapsed in the capital seven years ago and killed more than 1,000 people, there was an outcry about ethics in the industry and nearly 200 brands and more than 1,600 factories signed an agreement promoting safe working environments for workers. <br><br>\"They talk about sustainability, they talk about ethics,\" Hasanat said. \"So this is the time to showcase their good words, whether they really believe [in] these ethics.\" <br><br>The role of international brands <br><br>CNN Business reached out to several major international brands who do business with Bangladeshi factories for comment. <br><br>Some brands, including Swedish clothing chain H&M, US supermarket giant Walmart (WMT) and UK retailer Primark, have agreed to pay in part or in full for the goods they already ordered. <br><br>\"We intend to honor our commitments to products that are finished or in the production process, and we are working with suppliers on a case-by-case basis to address any exceptions and develop solutions to minimize impact,\" Walmart said in a statement. The company estimates that the \"exceptions\" amount to less than 2% of their annual apparel orders in Bangladesh. <br><br>Primark, which Penn State's study named as a brand that failed to make a firm commitment, said Monday that it will now \"take all product that was both in production and finished, and planned for handover by April 17.\" <br><br>But others, including Gap (GPS), have not made any assurances, said Aruna Kashyap, senior counsel in the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. <br><br>\"These workers are really poor,\" said Kashyap, who is based in Dhaka. \"They have worked in the supply chains and the operations of these brands for months and years. And at this moment of crisis it's really important for brands and retailers to live up to their human rights responsibilities.\" <br><br>Asked whether the company would pay for goods ordered from Bangladeshi factories, Gap told CNN Business that the company is \"making decisions based on the best interest of our employees, customers and partners, as well as the long-term health of our business,\" including reducing expenses after closing stores in North America and Europe. <br><br>\"We are committed to working closely with our long-standing suppliers to best assess how we can work together through this crisis,\" the company said. <br><br>Others connected to the American retail industry, though, pointed out that the pandemic has been crippling them, too. US retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, the worst monthly decline on record. <br><br>The situation has \"created a temporary liquidity crisis that is threatening to burn a permanent hole in global supply chains,\" said Steve Lamar, the President and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. <br><br>\"That is why we need governments to work together and with global financial institutions to make sure there are enough financial resources to keep supply chains solvent, so they can keep workers employed during these crises,\" Lamar said. \"Common sense measures like deferring tariff payments and fully funding loan programs for retailers \u2014 now largely closed \u2014 are just two of the tools all governments should be implementing.\" <br><br>A uncertain future <br><br>The Bangladeshi government is providing some assistance. In March and April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced more than $8.5 billion in stimulus measures that includes loans to help factory owners pay worker salaries. <br><br>\"The Prime Minister [is] very much serious on this,\" said Munshi, the commerce minister. \"No one should die of starvation. They have to get their money, they have to live.\" Munshi said Hasina has instructed factory owners to look after their workers. <br><br>Even so, factory owners said they are concerned about taking out the government loans. The money would still have to be repaid within two years \u2014 a commitment they feared making given how unclear the coronavirus pandemic remains. <br><br>\"The government is doing their best,\" said Hasanat, of Viyellatex Group. \"But we are not a rich country, we don't have much foreign reserves, so I'm also worried about whether the government has the capability to support [during] this uncertainty.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "222", "title": "The dangerous morality behind the 'Open it Up' movement"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

As a \"stower\" at the facility, he was responsible for registering products into an inventory system before storing them on shelves for others to pick and pack. It was \"fairly stressful\" work, the 28 year old said, but he stuck with it in large part out of loyalty to his colleagues. <br><br>Like many at this particular Amazon (AMZN) facility, Mohamed is of Somali descent. During his years at the warehouse, he played a central role in organizing for better protections for his colleagues. Mohamed, an avid news consumer, said he began voicing concerns in February about the threat coronavirus could pose to workers and later advocated for greater worker protections as the pandemic worsened in the United States. <br><br>Mohamed distributed paper petitions to workers in Somali and English and said he expressed concerns to management about what he called the impossibility of practicing social distancing in the facility. To his surprise, Mohamed said he was given a \"final warning\" in late March for allegedly not following the recommendation for six feet of social distancing while speaking to a colleague in the parking lot, an incident he said he asked for proof of but was not given. He was ultimately fired earlier this month for what Amazon claims, in a statement to CNN Business, was \"a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language, behavior, and violating social distancing guidelines.\" <br><br>But Mohamed has a different view. \"They fired me to make others scared,\" he told CNN Business. \"I was the top target.\"  <br><br>Mohamed's firing, and the concerns expressed about it by several of his colleagues to CNN Business, highlight the tension between Amazon and its warehouse workers over safety and benefits during an unprecedented public health crisis. With their health potentially on the line, there has been renewed worker activism at a number of Amazon facilities during the pandemic -- and with it, claims by workers that Amazon is retaliating. Amazon denies those claims. <br><br>Mohamed and another worker at the facility were the second and third known employees at Amazon distribution facilities in the US who were fired earlier this month. In late March, Christian Smalls -- who led a protest outside Amazon's Staten Island facility over the company's response to coronavirus -- was the first to be terminated. (The company similarly said Smalls had \"received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines\" and was fired after attending a worker protest at the facility despite being under a 14-day quarantine.) <br><br>In a statement about Mohamed's firing, and allegations of retaliation, Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish told CNN Business the company has \"zero tolerance for retaliation against employees who raise concerns and respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so; however, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.\" <br><br>The e-commerce giant has seen soaring demand for its products and services during the pandemic as people stay home and increasingly look to Amazon as a lifeline for household essentials. But it has also become the subject of increased scrutiny as warehouse workers express concerns about a range of issues \u2014 from crowded hiring events and training sessions to limited access to disinfectant wipes and the company's overall ability to follow through on its commitments. <br><br>There have been numerous cases of Amazon warehouse employees testing positive for coronavirus in the US and around the world. Amazon told CNN Business there have not been any confirmed cases at the Shakopee location to date. <br><br>Amazon, which has 400,000 employees across 110 fulfillment centers in North America, has not provided much information concerning the number of confirmed cases at its facilities. When asked on CNN last week, Amazon's top spokesperson Jay Carney said, \"I don't have a specific number.\" <br><br>Inside Shakopee <br><br>Inside the Shakopee facility, the potential for confusion or miscommunication is particularly high, some workers said. Many are immigrants whose first language is not English. A large contingent, like Mohamed, are Somali or East African; Minnesota has the largest population of Somalis in the US, with nearly 49,000 Somali residents, according to a 2018 Economic Status of Minnesotans report.  <br><br>To staff its Shakopee facility, which opened in 2016 and has over 1,000 employees, Amazon made a concerted effort to recruit East African immigrants, according to the New York Times.  <br><br>Roughly 80% of Somalis in Minnesota are living at or near poverty level, according to the same economic report. (Amazon declined to comment on the demographic breakdown of Shakopee facility workers.) <br><br>\"The workforce in any given community reflects the community around it,\" Dania Rajendra, the director of the Athena, a coalition of organizations focused on confronting Amazon's growing power. \"Amazon's communications about its changing policies and about what to expect at work is uneven at best. When you add language barriers into an already failing communication mechanism, it just exacerbates all of those challenges.\"  <br><br>Mohamed, who commuted to the facility from where he lives in Minneapolis, about 40 minutes away, speaks English and Somali. He said he had been communicating with colleagues in the facility about coronavirus in English because his colleagues speak a mix of languages, including Spanish.   <br><br>Some Shakopee workers told CNN Business about what they called a lack of clarity around new policies. In some cases, even those who do understand English well said they are having trouble keeping up with the pace of updates that come in various forms. <br><br>Sahro Sharif, an Amazon associate at Shakopee, said the company recently implemented rules on which stairs could be accessed to minimize contact with others. \"One you can only go up and the other you can only come down,\" said Sharif. \"I never even noticed the sign until someone said something to me.\"  <br><br>Amazon said it encourages employees to communicate concerns to management and that all facilities communicate policy updates in a variety of ways, including through on-site teams focused on educating employees about safety measures.  <br><br>The company has instituted a number of changes at facilities across the country in response to the pandemic. That has included: staggering shift start times and break times to reduce congestion, temperature screenings at the beginning of shifts, and in recent days, requiring workers to wear masks provided by the company. The company said it has made over 150 process updates to date to ensure the health and safety of its employees.  <br><br>Mohamed, and some of his coworkers, feel he was singled out for speaking up. <br><br>\"It seems like what they're trying to say is if this warehouse is dangerous, it's dangerous because of the workers -- not because we have hundreds of workers coming in, touching surfaces or because we are bringing on hundreds of new hires and continuing to ship non-essential stuff,\" said William Stolz, an Amazon associate at the facility and friend of Mohamed's.   <br><br>\"At the same time, they've used some of their policies, and the ways they've applied them, to target certain people who have been involved in organizing or people who have had more disagreements with management,\" Stolz added. <br><br>A history of worker complaints and activism <br><br>Before coronavirus, Amazon had been criticized over safety concerns and treatment of its workers, including by some at the Shakopee facility. In 2018 and 2019, Minnesota workers, including those CNN Business spoke to for this article, helped lead protests against the company over issues including what they viewed as unrealistic productivity rates. <br><br>For some, like Hibaq Mohamed, another Somali immigrant who has worked as an Amazon associate for more than three and a half years at the Shakopee facility and has advocated for changes, getting coronavirus poses a risk not just to her health but also to that of her sister and her sister's two children, one of whom has severe asthma. <br><br>She called the warehouse conditions, which she said are crowded as the company continues to add new hires, \"unacceptable, scary and disappointing.\"  <br><br>The company is providing two weeks of paid leave for those who have confirmed cases of the coronavirus or are placed in quarantine. It is also offering unlimited unpaid time off. Amazon said it moved all new hire events and orientations to virtual platforms on March 23. <br><br>\"They say, if you're worried about it to go home without pay. We're living paycheck to paycheck, that's impossible,\" Hibaq said. \"When we speak up, we receive what Bashir received. [Amazon is] not focusing on how to protect the community from this coronavirus spreading -- they focus on how to shut us up.\"  <br><br>Workers and organizations have filed complaints with the federal government to call attention to issues inside several warehouses across the country. Awood, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that advocates for East African workers, filed an Occupation Safety and Health Administration complaint in early April after an employee at the Shakopee facility was believed by their doctor to have coronavirus. In the complaint, Awood said the company needs to communicate this to workers, as well as close and clean the warehouse and ensure workers do not have to choose between their jobs and their health.  <br><br>The company said it shares with employees when there is a confirmed case where they work. <br><br>Last Wednesday, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called for a federal investigation into the firing of Mohamed and the other employee at the facility. In her letter, she called the firings \"outrageous\" and said they were \"a clear violation of whistleblower protection provisions.\" <br><br>\"These accusations are simply unfounded,\" said Amazon's Kish. \"Nothing is more important than the safety of our teams. Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.\" <br><br>Meanwhile, Mohamed, who continues to consult with his now former colleagues about coronavirus through a WhatsApp group, said he plans to file for unemployment. \"My goal,\" he said, \"is to create a safe place.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "223", "title": "With lobbying push, gyms get on Phase One of Trump's reopening plan"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Researchers estimate that we've only identified 25% of all bat species in the last 15 years. They're difficult to locate and study, so we lack information about where they live, how they evolved and their true role in the world around them.  <br><br>\"Bats are small, nocturnal and use high-frequency sound and smell to identify their species to other bats,\" said Bruce Patterson, lead study author and Macarthur curator of mammals at Chicago's Field Museum, in an email. \"Because we are large, diurnal and reliant on vision (and lower-frequency sounds), we can't read their signals very precisely. The real diversity of bats has really opened up in the last 25 years with DNA sequence and ultrasonic recorder technology that helps us recognize the signals bats are using.\" <br><br>The new bat species were actually discovered largely based on museum specimens that were collected in Africa over the last few decades.  <br><br>Leaf-nosed bats live in Asia, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, but the species in Africa haven't been studied as much because the areas where they live are inaccessible. They get their name from unique skin flaps on their noses that act like radar to help them catch insects and orient their signals to others. <br><br>The researchers used DNA to study the museum specimens of leaf-nosed bats and realized that although some of them appeared very similar to known species, they were genetically different.  <br><br>\"The most surprising thing to me about this study was that we failed to find much genetic support for long-recognized species, and found trenchant differences existing within what had been considered a single species,\" Patterson said. <br><br>Preparing for potential virus vectors <br><br>The new species haven't been named yet. And the researchers want to follow up their work by looking for patterns in their anatomy, echolocation calls and the parasites they carry. <br><br>\"None of these leaf-nosed bats carry a disease that's problematic today, but we don't know that that's always going to be the case. And we don't even know the number of species that exist,\" said Terry Demos, study co-author and a post-doctoral researcher in Patterson's lab, in a statement.  <br><br>\"Leaf-nosed bats carry coronaviruses -- not the strain that's affecting humans right now, but this is certainly not the last time a virus will be transmitted from a wild mammal to humans. If we have better knowledge of what these bats are, we'll be better prepared if that happens.\" <br><br>Patterson concurred. \"With Covid-19, we have a virus that's running amok in the human population,\" he said. \"It originated in a horseshoe bat in China. There are 25 or 30 species of horseshoe bats in China, and no one can determine which one was involved. We owe it to ourselves to learn more about them and their relatives.\" <br><br>Other viruses and diseases contracted by humans have been associated with bats. It's possible that the bats carry viruses due to their social nature, rather than being dirty virus magnets.  <br><br>\"All organisms have viruses. The roses in your garden have viruses,\" Patterson said. \"We worry about viruses when it comes to flu and pandemics, but viruses are part of nature and have been as far back as we go. And many viruses are harmless. Because [bats] huddle together and take care of each other, it doesn't take long for a pathogen to get passed from one end of the colony to the other.\" <br><br>And bats can also fly, which makes them incredibly strong -- likely making them carriers of disease rather than prone to being sick themselves. Bats have high metabolism, self-repairing DNA and hearty immune systems.  <br><br>\"Flying is the most energetically expensive way to get around. If you skin a bat, it looks like Mighty Mouse, they have hardly any guts, they're all shoulders and chest muscle. They're incredible athletes,\" Patterson said.  <br><br>The human factor <br><br>Humans come in contact with bats by destroying their habitats, hunting them and eating bat meat. Bat meat consumption occurs in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Islands (meaning Oceania), Patterson said.  <br><br>\"Unless you try to seek out bats, either to harass them or kill them, it's very, very unlikely that they'll infect you,\" Demos said. <br><br>Bat guano, or poop, is considered to be an excellent fertilizer, so it's mined from caves. This can disturb the millions of bats in just one cave colony, Patterson said.  <br><br>Bats can also ingest pesticides and environmental toxins when they eat hundreds of insects each night. And people \"respond to viral fears\" by purposely lashing out at bat habitats, Patterson said.  <br><br>Harming bats will not curb disease, but a better understanding of bats might.  <br><br>\"These bats have a place in nature and perform essential ecological functions, and we can't let our terror of Covid cause us to pull apart natural ecological systems,\" Patterson said.  <br><br>Patterson hopes that this moment of interest leads to more research about bats, as well as a clearer picture of how coronavirus jumped from bats to humans. <br><br>\"In addition to their numerous services for mankind, we know that bats carry a substantial number of viruses,\" Patterson said. \"A bat species can carry only those viruses to which it has been exposed, and only so far as its range limits. So understanding who is out there and where they live constitutes a roadmap for the ecological connections that currently elude us in figuring out who was carrying SARS coV-2 in the wild.\" <br><br>Clarification: The current version of this story reflects a broader definition of the geographic areas where bat meat is consumed. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "125", "title": "A real life 'Contagion': Humans may be to blame for viruses jumping from animals to us"}, {"id": "161", "title": "What is coronavirus and Covid-19?

But the drive she once had to study fizzled out when her upcoming high school exams were canceled due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  <br><br>\"It's really stressful,\" she told CNN of the year she spent revising for now what seems like nothing. \"I wanted to prove to myself and to others that I could push my grades up.\" <br><br>The inequality gap between rich and poor, present in education systems at the best of times, is being exacerbated by school closures worldwide, experts say. Poorer students are facing increased obstacles to achieving good grades as they contend with a lack of space to work, problems reaching online resources and psychological challenges.  <br><br>In England, teachers and exam boards will now predict grades for the GCSE exams by taking \"performance on mock exams and non-exam assessment\" into account as well as \"other relevant data, including prior attainment,\" the UK Department of Education wrote in a statement.   <br><br>Bosman Quarshie's mother, Valerie, says the economic conditions during lockdown have put the family on the poverty line. On top of that, research shows that disadvantaged children have a greater chance of their grades being under-assessed compared to their richer peers.  <br><br>A 2017 study by education charity the Sutton Trust found that \"high attaining disadvantaged students are more likely to have their grades under-predicted than their richer counterparts.\"  <br><br>\"When I go to bed, I'm in tears, sobbing, because it's all been taken away from her,\" Valerie told CNN, \"because let's be honest, the system doesn't work in our favor as black minority ethnics.\" <br><br>CNN has contacted the UK's Department of Education for comment on how predictive grading will affect students from disadvantaged backgrounds. <br><br>'Stress test a system of structural inequalities' <br><br>Across the globe more than 1.5 billion students, or more than 90% of the world's learners, are stuck at home due to school closures in about 190 countries, according to UNESCO estimates. As educators scramble to put out online learning courses in a bid to teach young people remotely, experts CNN talked to from Asia, Africa, Europe and the US fear the coronavirus crisis is amplifying educational inequality -- putting low-income students at a greater disadvantage than their wealthier peers.  <br><br>\"The pandemic is going to cause the greatest disruption to education opportunity that the world has experienced in at least a century,\" said Fernando M. Reimers, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. \"The combined effects of them [school closures] is going to basically stress test a system of structural inequalities that was already bad to begin.\" <br><br>Educators wonder if the period out of school will lead to a variation of the phenomenon known as summer learning loss, where students -- especially from disadvantaged backgrounds -- lose months of learning, particularly in mathematics, during the holidays.  <br><br>Studies suggest that these students may not be able to afford summer school or activities enjoyed by higher-income students, therefore exacerbating the achievement gap between both groups.   <br><br>\"So the big concern now is if we have an extended period out of education, are we going to see children from disadvantaged families doing even worse in school than they already do?\" Stephen Tierney, chairman of the UK think tank Headteachers' Roundtable, told CNN.  <br><br>The digital divide  <br><br>In many countries, vast segments of society lack the tools needed for connectivity -- be it a working device or reliable internet connection. This so-called digital divide is particularly apparent in China, where more than 540 million people -- or nearly 40% of the population -- are not online, according to a government agency report from 2019. <br><br>Many children, who once had to walk for miles to the nearest school, now have to contend with a lack of digital access in the lockdown. <br><br>A stark situation reportedly emerged in February for a ninth grader in a small village in Henan province, central China. According to state-backed newspaper Beijing News, the student apparently attempted suicide after struggling to access a smartphone in order to take part in online classes. Her story then went viral on Chinese social media. <br><br>On March 2, the Henan provincial education department issued a directive, ordering city and county governments to find and help disadvantaged students who lacked the technology needed to learn online. <br><br>In the US, the Federal Communications Commission estimated that 21 million Americans lacked access to broadband in 2019. The lack of a reliable internet connection to do homework was more pronounced among black, Hispanic and lower-income families, according to a Pew survey in 2015. <br><br>Another Pew survey in 2018 found that even before the pandemic, about 17% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 said they were often -- or sometimes -- unable to finish homework assignments because of the lack of a connection or a computer.  <br><br>Earl Martin Phalen runs a network of 22 tuition-free public and charter schools across the US -- where 93% of his students come from low-income communities. He told CNN that he has been scrambling to secure 6,500 devices for his students, many of whom do not own a laptop or tablet. \"I believe that the government should be stepping up to support device access and connectivity for all students, but this is not happening,\" he said.  <br><br>Many school districts have struggled to obtain enough devices for students learning at home, which has yet to be addressed by the federal government. The Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Ajit Pai, announced in March that more than 650 broadband and telephone service providers agreed to take his \"Keep Americans Connected Pledge,\" promising not to cut off customers whose lives have been disrupted by the pandemic while opening their WiFi hotspots to anyone who needs them. <br><br>One of Phalen's students, Kyiah Minor, 16, cannot wait to get her hands on a device as it has been a struggle to see her teacher's slides while using her smartphone to attend Zoom learning sessions. \"I think it [the lockdown] sucks because some kids at our school are having trouble understanding the work, and it is hard for them to understand this work without someone teaching them,\" Minor, who lives in Indianapolis, told CNN.  <br><br>While her school has provided learning packets, she worries that the loss of whole schooldays could set many people back in the next academic year.  <br><br>A safe and quiet space to work <br><br>Beyond a loss of learning, lockdown measures can result in children lacking a quiet place to work -- or being unsafe at home. It is situation made worse by rising economic uncertainty, says Eric Hazard, African policy director at Save the Children.  <br><br>Online learning is not an option for many children in sub-Saharan Africa, and Save the Children is concerned about the lack of mechanisms for young people to study at home.  <br><br>Agencies found that during the 2015 Ebola epidemic, child exploitation and violence against girls in Sierra Leone had increased during school closures. Hazard worries that Covid-19 lockdowns could see those sort of problems return.  <br><br>\"Children who are out of school are also at greater risk of being recruited into labor, abuse and exploitation, and for girls, they are more likely to never return to school once lessons recommence,\" Hazard told CNN.  <br><br>\"As pressures mount on low-income families, children may need to work to bolster family incomes or be victim of child marriage, and girls especially may also face a disproportionate burden of caring for family members who contract the virus or taking care of younger children.\"  <br><br>In an opinion piece for CNN, Joe Torre, former manager of the New York Yankees and chairman of the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation, wrote that \"stay at home\" will not always translate to \"safe at home\" in many households across the US.  <br><br>Mental health <br><br>Schools help instil routine and coping mechanisms for students, and educators worry about the psychological toll the lockdown is inflicting on young learners.  <br><br>Children are aware of the growing health emergency and have been seeking support. Childline, a 24-hour emergency phone helpline for children in India, reported a 50% increase in calls since the lockdown was implemented there.  <br><br>\"The current pandemic has resulted in a loss of predictability, loss of routine, loss of classroom learning and loss of exposure to space,\" a spokesperson from Childline told CNN.  <br><br>The Indian government extended its nationwide lockdown earlier this week until May 3, and the country's most vulnerable children are experiencing bearing the brunt of the unprecedented outbreak, said experts working in the field.  <br><br>\"It is affecting their mental well-being. They are experiencing arguments between the parents, there is domestic violence at times,\" Chetan Gupta, director of Chetna, an NGO which works with street children, told CNN. According to Gupta, there are about 200,000 street kids living in New Delhi, many of whom are now sequestered in small temporary huts, with sometimes no electricity or ventilation. <br><br>Children with special education needs are also struggling in the crisis, Professor Catherine So Wing-chee, an educational psychologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNN.  <br><br>So, who helps students with autism, said school closures are disrupting children's schedules and affecting their ability to socialize. \"Right now, they go to bed around 11 p.m. or midnight... As long as the daily routines are messed up, the cognitive, social and language developments of these kids are also messed up,\" So said. <br><br>Educators are reporting similar challenges in the UK. Joanne Kelly, headteacher of The Pavilion school in London, which caters to students who have been excluded from mainstream institutions, says the shutdown could reset the good work achieved among her students suffering from anxiety.  <br><br>\"I don't want them to go backwards,\" she said. \"These are young people who refused to leave their bedrooms, who are taught with a teacher outside the bedroom, and then we get them to the kitchen to be taught at home, and then get them to into school,\" she said of the months of work required to get some students to gain their trust. \"I'm worried, this [shutdown] is really going to set them back.\" <br><br>Tara John reported and wrote from London, Nectar Gan reported from Hong Kong, and Swati Gupta reported from New Delhi.

Demonstrators dressed head-to-toe in black, and wearing face masks, circled on bicycles. Police shouted over megaphones, warning that assemblies were illegal during the pandemic and urging the women to go home. <br><br>As governments across Europe continued to grapple with the worst health care crisis of the modern era, Polish lawmakers debated draft legislation last week that would ban abortion in the case of fetal abnormalities -- one of the few remaining circumstances in which the procedure is still allowed in the majority Catholic country.   <br><br>Ultimately, Poland's lower house voted to send the bill to a parliamentary commission for more work. But the timing, which was slammed by human rights campaigners, presented a fresh challenge for women's rights activists who have been fending off an abortion ban for years: how to protest in the time of coronavirus. <br><br>\"We saw this as an attempt by the government to use the lockdown to push for this controversial law, because, as history shows, all these attempts of the government to amend the abortion law have always triggered a lot of demonstrations,\" Gorczynska said, referring to a nationwide \"Black Monday\" strike in 2016 that drew millions. <br><br>\"If there was no lockdown, thousands of women would have been on the streets. So we were using other tools, especially online ones.\" <br><br>Those who couldn't come out found other ways of demonstrating. Protesters rallied around hashtags like \"black protests\" and \"women's hell\" on social media, sharing photos of themselves in black and white or holding abortion pills in their palms. Others hung posters from their balconies or went out for their daily exercise with messages of resistance taped to their backs. <br><br>But the abortion bill is part of a wider problem, according to campaigners and academics who say that Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) is using the pandemic to continue chipping away at democracy and tightening its grip on power. <br><br>\"What's happening now is the next stage in the destruction of our new democratic state,\" Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at Warsaw University, told CNN. She pointed to 11th hour changes to how Poland votes and proposals to extend the length of presidential terms as worrying signs of what's ahead.  <br><br>The government is still planning to hold a presidential election on May 10, though a majority of Poles -- not to mention opposition politicians -- want to postpone it because of the outbreak.   <br><br>On March 28, the PiS rammed a bill through the lower house that would allow the election to go ahead by postal ballot, even though the country's top court previously ruled that no changes can be made to the electoral code within six months of the vote. The bill has now moved to the senate for debate.  <br><br>CNN has made several attempts to reach out to the PiS and the government for comment. <br><br>Materska-Sosnowska fears that changes to the electoral process would put the integrity of the vote at risk. While opposition candidates have had very limited opportunities to campaign, President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the PiS, has unfettered access to airtime and is ahead in the polls. <br><br>The European Union's parliament said Friday that holding the elections in the middle of the outbreak could endanger lives and was \"totally incompatible with European values.\" The parliament also singled out Poland's ally Hungary -- which recently passed a law allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely -- for criticism.  <br><br>The EU triggered \"Article 7\" disciplinary measures against Poland after the PiS launched an assault on the independence of the country's judiciary, but the move has led nowhere. <br><br>On Monday, opposition lawmakers began talks with politicians from the junior party in the PiS's ruling coalition about delaying the vote, hoping to capitalize on growing divisions in the alliance.   <br><br>Draginja Nadazdin, the director of Amnesty International Poland, suggested that if the coronavirus was a test of whether governments are committed to human rights, then Poland was failing. <br><br>\"If you want to use the coronavirus as a kind of test, to gauge how the government supports human rights, neither Poland's approach to abortion, neither its approach to free and fair elections, nor its approach to the right to health, are good signals,\" Nadazdin told CNN. <br><br>Campaigners in Poland worry that women's access to health care is already being curtailed, with or without the latest bill. <br><br>Justyna Wydrzynska, an activist with Aborcyjny Dream Team, a charity that helps Polish women with access to abortions, says their hotline, which normally receives around 10 calls a day, started ringing off the hook after the government announced border closures to stop the spread of the virus. <br><br>Many of the callers were concerned that they would no longer be able to obtain abortion pills, which are illegal in Poland, and others feared they would not be able to reach clinics abroad in time to have procedures.  <br><br>Abortions in Poland are only permitted in the case of some fetal abnormalities, rape, incest or a threat to the mother's health. And even in cases when an abortion is allowed, many Polish women still struggle to find hospitals that will perform the procedure. <br><br>Wydrzynska was assisting one woman who had to cross the Polish border by foot into Germany, where she caught a train to Berlin and then flew to the UK. After the journey to London, she had an ultrasound and decided not to go through with the procedure. <br><br>\"It's incredibly stressful,\" Wydrzynska said, adding that European countries who previously assisted with abortion procedures have told the charity they can no longer provide services to foreigners. \"What can we say to them ... we hope it's not the end of the story.\" <br><br>And Poland isn't alone -- women's access to abortion has become one of many healthcare provisions thrown into jeopardy globally. <br><br>In several US states, lawmakers have tried to introduce new restrictions on abortion, citing public health concerns. Some Republican governors, including Greg Abbott in Texas, have argued that abortion is a non-essential medical procedure and should be delayed during the pandemic to conserve personal protective equipment and other life-saving gear.  <br><br>Critics have accused these states of exploiting the coronavirus crisis to limit women's access to abortion, and the bans have ended up in the courts. <br><br>When it comes to women's rights in Poland, protesters there say they'll continue to fight -- lockdown or not. <br><br>\"It was even more important to show our strength, to show solidarity and to show that this lockdown doesn't mean that we have our hands tied,\" Gorczynska said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

China has donated large amounts of medical supplies to parts of Europe and Africa. China's state media, which has an outsized influence in much of the developing world, has also played up praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) and others of its response to and recovery from the initial outbreak, in stark contrast to many parts of the world now struggling to cope.  <br><br>The coronavirus crisis presents a key opportunity for China to solidify its status as a superpower and global leader, particularly as the United States has struggled to contain the outbreak, and US President Donald Trump has alienated some allies with his \"America first\" approach to the crisis.  <br><br>At the same time, however, Beijing has not been able to avoid intense scrutiny and criticism -- mainly, but not solely from Washington -- over how initial delays in the country's response may have squandered vital opportunities to contain the now global pandemic, as well as skepticism over its reporting of coronavirus figures and the country's recovery.  <br><br>In perhaps a sign of how China's leaders are determined not to let this moment pass them by, or to be cast as global villain, the response to any such criticism has been forceful and often angry. It has been boosted not only by state media but also a new breed of diplomat taking their message directly to foreign audiences on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.   <br><br>No backing down <br><br>When reports emerged of Africans being mistreated and discriminated against in southern China this month over coronavirus fears -- sparking criticism and concern from several governments on the continent -- Beijing might have been expected to show willingness to take the incident seriously <br><br>China has invested billions in shoring up economic and diplomatic relations across the African continent in recent years, and has long boasted of its commitment to uplifting developing countries across the region, without the kind of economic and political conditions imposed by the US. <br><br>And yet, rather than condemn those responsible for the alleged anti-African discrimination, Chinese diplomats and state media have pushed back hard against the reports, accusing Western media and the US government of trying to drive a wedge between Beijing and its allies in Africa. In recent days, some have even criticized African media for being \"misled\" by reports in the international press.  <br><br>\"China-Africa traditional friendship will not be disturbed by instigation of some forces,\" Hua Chunying, Director of China's Foreign Ministry Information Department, said on Twitter Wednesday.  <br><br>Earlier she accused the US State Department of lying about the allegations of racial discrimination, which have been reported by CNN and other media and highlighted by African diplomats in China, adding \"Asian Americans experienced racism during the pandemic. How would @statedeptspox explain that?\" <br><br>Hua only jointed Twitter -- which is blocked by China's Great Firewall -- relatively recently, one of a number of Chinese diplomats and foreign ministry officials who have taken to the platform to get their message out.  <br><br>A pioneer of this approach is Hua's subordinate and replacement as top foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian. A former senior diplomat to Pakistan, Zhao was one of the first Chinese officials to take to Twitter, where he regularly sparred with foreign media and politicians.  <br><br>During the pandemic, Zhao has emerged as China's leading defender and critic of Western responses to the virus. In March, Washington summoned China's ambassador to the US to complain over tweets Zhao posted suggesting that the US military may have been responsible for bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan, where cases were first detected last year.  <br><br>While parts of Chinese state media have long adopted an aggressive, often jingoistic tone, the country's diplomats have typically been more calm and tactful, at least in public.  <br><br>\"Chinese diplomats were once known for their conservative, low profile in China and world affairs,\" the Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese state-backed tabloid, said in a piece this week. \"Internationally, our diplomats were considered enigmatic, and Chinese people were called 'inscrutable.' It was a time of much less adversity or need to fend off inordinate criticisms from the glorious West.\" <br><br>Last year, Hua wrote an influential piece in a party journal calling for diplomats to embrace the \"fighting spirit\" and \"enhance (China's) international voice,\" remarks that were reportedly echoed by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a gathering of top diplomats in December.  <br><br>Bringing this \"fighting spirit\" to Twitter, \"is just the latest manifestation of a long-term project,\" analyst Mareike Ohlberg wrote last year in a report published by the Mercator Institute for China Studies. \"The (Communist Party's) aim was, and remains, to change global debates about China -- and any other topic the Party cares about -- to bring them closer in line with its own position. Its intention is to gradually change the conversation and increase the Party's 'discourse power'.\" <br><br>The Global Times piece praised the new \"Wolf Warrior\"-style diplomacy of late, referencing a popular Chinese action movie series in which the country's military enacts daring operations around the world.  <br><br>\"As China rises and walks close to center stage of the world, facilitated by the relative decline of the West, many Western countries are feeling uncomfortable, which is behind their unwarranted accusations against China,\" the paper said. \"As Western diplomats fall into disgrace, they are getting a taste of China's 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy.\" <br><br>New approach <br><br>The importance of changing the conversation around the coronavirus and China's handling of it is clear, which may explain why the more aggressive approach favored by diplomats like Zhao and Hua has come to dominate Beijing's response.  <br><br>James Green, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University and former US diplomat, told CNN in an email that \"to deflect poor handling of the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and the loss of life and economic growth domestically, the CCP propaganda organs are in overdrive to match the new narrative: China and the CCP are saving the world from the scourge of the coronavirus -- and the world is grateful!\" <br><br>On Wednesday, Zhao said that \"those who accuse China of being untransparent are unjust and insulting to the great sacrifices made by the Chinese people,\" and hit out against \"false allegations propagated by US officials relentlessly.\"  <br><br>Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and former Australian diplomat in China, said that \"some of the loudest voices on Twitter of late have been rewarded with promotions,\" including Zhao and China's former ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian.  <br><br>However, she added that it's still not clear that this type whether this trend is as a result of a dictat from above, or officials attempting to get the attention of their superiors, as well as approving coverage in state media and on Chinese social platforms.  <br><br>\"So often we assume Chinese officials are speaking to the outside world, and we wonder -- why would they say that?\" Kassam said. \"It's more likely that individual officials are adopting an aggressive tone to demonstrate loyalty to the center.\"   <br><br>Jeff Moon, who served as a US diplomat in China as well as assistant US trade representative for China affairs under President Trump, said that \"what has changed is not the substance or tone of China's public diplomacy, but the fact that we now take China's official propaganda more seriously due to China's increasing global influence.\"  <br><br>Green agreed that the \"narrative of shifting global power balances imbues each statement or off-handed remark with seeming gravity and importance,\" in a way that wouldn't necessarily be the case in the past.  <br><br>Indeed, Moon argues that the more aggressive approach taken by diplomats today might be more a return to historical form, when Beijing's representatives railed against \"capitalist running dogs\" and accused Washington of pursuing regime change.  <br><br>\"Other countries did not take such statements seriously until they began having a tangible impact on world affairs,\" Moon said. \"The Covid-19 crisis is the latest -- and perhaps the most significant -- example of how Chinese policy statements affect world affairs. There is a new generation of Chinese officials that is using Twitter and other new tools aggressively, but that is a change of tactics rather than strategy.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "120", "title": "The world is coming together to fight coronavirus.

UPS employees\u00a0on working during\u00a0the pandemic", "content": "gton, DC (CNN)At UPS, the most frantic time of year is typically around the winter holidays. Then things level off. But these days, as the coronavirus pandemic spurs American households and businesses to buy almost everything online, the deliveries have seemed relentless. <br><br>Online sales data and anecdotal evidence from employees we spoke to show the volume of packages handled has significantly increased. That has many UPS (UPS) workers putting in long, physically exhausting hours while, at the same time, taking extra precautions to protect themselves from infection. <br><br>\"I'm working more than I ever have in almost 24 years at UPS,\" Jack Warren, a UPS delivery driver based out of Providence, Rhode Island, tells CNN. Warren is also a union steward and is in charge of the safety committee at his facility. He says the team spends extra time cleaning \"handrails, doorknobs, some of the machinery,\" including the trucks and forklifts. Drivers, who walk into dozens of public spaces a day, also carry paper towels and cleaning spray, he said. <br><br>At UPS's massive Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, which processes roughly 2 million packages a day, two employees have died from Covid-19, according to Teamsters Local 89, which represents workers at Worldport, and a Clarke County, Indiana health official. It's unclear where the workers contracted the virus, the company said. \"COVID-19 is a community-spread virus. There is no way to know how/where someone contracted it,\" wrote UPS spokesman Jim Mayer in an email to CNN.  <br><br>The company won't confirm how many workers have gotten sick, he added. <br><br>The company has put several measures in place to keep workers safe. UPS began distributing masks and personal protective equipment to workers in early April, Mayer said. To encourage social distancing, he said, the company has also added markings at six-foot intervals in areas where employees are likely to gather. At Worldport, it has rented school buses so workers can spread out while on company shuttles, Mayer said.  <br><br>UPS said it is also offering two weeks of paid sick leave to workers who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed under a quarantine. But some workers say more could be done: A Change.org petition demanding hazard pay for UPS workers has received nearly 240,000 signatures. The company said it's not providing hazard pay at this time.  <br><br>The coronavirus has impacted the lives of many UPS delivery drivers, package handlers and their families. CNN spoke with some of them about their experiences. Here's what they had to say (these comments below have been edited for clarity). <br><br>Jack Warren <br><br>UPS delivery driver and union steward in Providence, Rhode Island <br><br>I go in an hour early every day and oversee our safety committee. Every morning we make a new mixture of water and bleach and fill spray bottles. We spray parts of the building \u2014 handrails, doorknobs, some of the machinery. We've got 400 trucks that need to be sprayed twice a day. We even spray down the forklifts.  <br><br>When I get back at night, I stay for another hour. I spray out probably 75 trucks myself at night. <br><br>Guys always call me with concerns. Before this, I'd take 15 to 20 calls on a bad day. I take between 40 to 60 a day now. <br><br>Every truck has a roll of paper towels and a spray bottle. I don't think guys have realized how many doorknobs and elevator buttons we touch. Some guys go in over 200 places a day. <br><br>Brian Lee <br><br>UPS delivery driver in Seattle <br><br>We're getting flat out hammered right now. No one wants to go to the store, everyone buys everything online. <br><br>I'm working 60 hours a week. The kids are in bed when I leave for work and most nights they're in bed when I get home from work. I get home and I'm dead tired and I want to eat, take a shower and go to bed. <br><br>My wife definitely pays a price. She's tasked with trying to keep our kids going with online schooling. She doesn't get a break and she pretty much doesn't get to leave the house because she's not supposed to. And obviously my kids don't get to spend time with their dad during the week. <br><br>I've probably received more \"oh thank you so much for all you're doing,\" probably more the last two weeks than I have in the last 10 Christmases combined. That's typically when people notice how hard we're working. <br><br>Olyjawan Ford <br><br>UPS package handler in Lexington, Kentucky <br><br>I'm concerned every day. The disease can be on the boxes. We don't know who touched them, sneezed on them, coughed on them. There's all the people that are in the warehouse working. <br><br>In my house, we have four jobs \u2014 my girlfriend has two and I have two. Three of those jobs all shut down. It's just UPS right now. I like UPS, it's a good job. I had to do something to bring in some money. <br><br>In the beginning when this all started, I didn't feel they were [doing enough to protect us]. They weren't giving us gloves or anything like that. No masks, no hand sanitizer. Now they are. (UPS began handing out masks and other protective gear to workers in early April after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance.) <br><br>It was a debate that I had with myself, [to keep working and face the risks]. I thought about the unemployment. I don't make a lot of money at UPS. But I put together that my unemployment wouldn't be that much. It would probably be good for me just to keep working. <br><br>Sawyer Redden <br><br>UPS, first-aid responder and package loader in Louisville, Kentucky  <br><br>I'm the person on call when someone gets injured or has an asthma attack or something. It's possible if someone had Covid at UPS's Worldport facility, I'd be called to see them.  <br><br>But I've had to stop doing [the first-aid response work] because I live with two immune-compromised people. I struggle with the decision honestly. I do worry that, because I'm not on call, there's less people available to help. I still load packages to pay for college...If I didn't have the school debt I probably would've quit. <br><br>My mother is constantly stressed about this. I hope she takes comfort in the dozens of things I'm trying to do to limit this risk. She can see my shoes outside on the porch, the rubbing alcohol I keep on the side table for my hands. She can hear the dryer every morning as I wash my clothes.  <br><br>I tell her that somebody has to do this. Someone has to go into the line of fire. If we're being honest with each other, there's no way this is going to stop. There's no way that UPS is going to wake up tomorrow and say 'You know we're putting a bunch of people in danger. We can't reasonably do this anymore. Shut the whole place down.'  <br><br>That would destroy the economy.  <br><br>Brittany Rhynard  <br><br>Her fiance is a UPS delivery truck driver in Lexington, Kentucky <br><br>We see the stress they deal with. When they come home we see it on their faces. We know that they've had a hard day. What they're dealing with is what they deal with around the holidays, when people are ordering a lot of stuff online for Christmas.  <br><br>I was trying to find gloves to pack in his lunch bag and I personally gave him like a spray bottle with a bleach cleaner and hand sanitizer and stuff to make sure he was somewhat protected. <br><br>We got into it one day because he was getting ready to come into the house with his shoes and stripping down his uniform and putting it over a dining room chair and I was like, \"hold up.\" It makes us paranoid that they have been on the front line and could potentially bring it home. I'm worried about him. He's young, but he could get it. <br><br>I make him take his boots off outside. He goes in so many public places throughout the day. I have a towel for him to sit them on and I spray them down with a Clorox cleaner every night. It's made me feel a little crazy, but I feel like during these times they have to be, just to be cautious to make sure we aren't bringing those germs in the home. <br><br>I want people to understand when they do order something that is massive and heavy, just to give them something to do during this time, they need to find a way to say thank you to the person that's delivering it. <br><br>It's not easy. I get emotional thinking about it, because I see it. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "47", "title": "Every Day is Earth Day: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for April 22"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

New York City won't provide summer jobs to 75,000 youth and will keep its public pools shuttered. Maryland instituted a budget and hiring freeze to prepare for a projected $2.8 billion revenue shortfall. <br><br>The economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic is hammering state and local governments. With the majority of businesses shuttered in many states and tens of millions of workers filing for unemployment, states and cities are seeing their tax revenues dry up rapidly. That's opening gaping holes in their budgets for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, which begins July 1 in most states. <br><br>States and municipalities had been lobbying hard for another shot of federal assistance in the latest relief package, which passed the Senate earlier this week. But it was left out of the deal, despite support from Democratic leaders.  <br><br>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has slammed states' requests for more federal aid, saying Wednesday that Republicans are not interested in \"revenue replacement for state governments\" or \"solving their pension problems.\" <br><br>\"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,\" McConnell told Hugh Hewitt in a radio interview. \"It saves some cities. And there's no good reason for it not to be available.\" <br><br>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called McConnell's remarks \"just dumb\" on Thursday. \"States should declare bankruptcy? That's how you're going to bring this national economy back?\" he said. <br><br>Bankruptcy is not an option for states. Federal bankruptcy code does not allow state governments to declare bankruptcy, though municipalities can. <br><br>Democrats have said they hope to pass another coronavirus relief package that would potentially include assistance to state and local governments.  <br><br>Every form of state revenue has been hit <br><br>While one prominent former Republican governor, Nikki Haley of South Carolina -- who also served as President Donald Trump's UN ambassador -- publicly chastised states for fiscal mismanagement, states have in fact spent the last few years building up their rainy day funds to an all-time total high. But the revenue shortfalls now, amid unprecedented closures, are expected to far exceed those savings, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers. <br><br>All major forms of state and municipal revenue are cratering as people lose their jobs or incomes and stop shopping because they are staying home. Personal income taxes, capital gains, corporate profits, sales taxes and gas taxes, as well as gaming, tourism and oil revenue, are all expected to decline. <br><br>\"There really won't be a source of tax revenue that won't be impacted,\" Sigritz said. <br><br>Budget shortfalls are projected to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. A recent Moody's Analytics report found that state fiscal shock could total $203 billion through the end of fiscal 2021, roughly 18% to 23% of last year's general fund revenue.  <br><br>Even after taking reserves into account, 33 states would have to fill budget gaps of at least 5% and 21 of those states are looking at shortfalls of 10% or more. <br><br>Another analysis found that states could face shortfalls of $360 billion or more, even accounting for rainy day funds and federal aid, according to a recent Center for Budget and Policy Priorities report. <br><br>One governor and city leader after another has announced grim projections. Michigan's initial estimates suggest that state revenue could fall by $7 billion over the next 18 months because of social distancing and non-essential business closures.  <br><br>Pennsylvania, which is projecting a budget deficit of up to $5 billion, stopped paying nearly 9,000 state employees -- more than 10% of its workforce, earlier this month, after laying off 2,500 part-time and seasonal employees and interns. <br><br>What happened to the aid already approved <br><br>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, along with Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who may face a shortfall of more than $2 billion, wrote a letter to Trump last week asking for more federal aid. The plea from the Democratic trio followed a call from National Governors Association Chairman Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican of Maryland, and Cuomo, the vice chair, for Congress to allocate an additional $500 billion for states to meet their budget shortfalls. <br><br>Recognizing that states and municipalities are suffering financially in the pandemic, the federal government has already moved to help them. Congress included $150 billion in aid in the $2 trillion relief package that passed in late March. However, it can only be used to cover expenses incurred due to the public health emergency, not revenue issues, and is only open to large cities and counties. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve launched a program to directly buy up to $500 billion in short-term debt from states and large cities and counties to help them fund government operations and manage cash flow amid decreased revenues. <br><br>But most counties and cities can't tap into this aid, and they say they need help too. The National Association of Counties, National League of Cities and US Conference of Mayors last week called for a $250 billion federal assistance package for local governments.  <br><br>The latter two groups issued a joint report last week saying that 98% of mid-size cities project a revenue shortfall this year, with 38% of them expecting to lay off workers and just over half forecasting that police and public safety will be cut. <br><br>First responders will likely take a hit in Dayton <br><br>Dayton is one city that could use more federal aid. It is seeing \"pretty significant losses\" in March revenues and is concerned about April too, said Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat. <br><br>The city already furloughed nearly 500 workers, or about 28% of its staff, from the water department, parks and recreation and other areas. And all city agencies -- including the police and fire departments -- have to turn in plans next week to cut 18% from their budgets for the rest of this year.  <br><br>Whaley, who was a city commissioner during the Great Recession, said this economic downturn is twice or maybe three times as bad. <br><br>\"There's no way we'll survive this without cuts to police and fire,\" said Whaley, who also serves on the leadership team of the mayors conference. \"That's why federal help is so desperately needed.\" <br><br>CNN's Cristina Alesci and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this story. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "162", "title": "Coronavirus threatens other areas of scientific progress, researchers fear"}, {"id": "196", "title": "90% of the world's students are in lockdown.

Like the protesters and the healthcare worker, our country is poised, tensely, at a moral crossroads.  <br><br>A quandary now confronts policymakers across the country: Should we reopen the economy to help the majority or protect the lives of the vulnerable by remaining in lockdown?  <br><br>One answer to that question -- letting a minority suffer so that the majority may benefit -- is known as utilitarianism. And it's one of the most common, and controversial, ways of making moral choices. <br><br>In matters of life and death, like we're in now, strict utilitarianism can be downright dangerous. <br><br>\"This is a moment when every country in the world is facing the same set of ethical questions and dilemmas,\" said Anita Allen, a member of President Obama's bioethics committee.  <br><br>\"How we answer will be a real test of our humanity and sense of justice.\" <br><br>The moral calculations behind utilitarianism <br><br>The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 45,000 Americans and put some 22 million out of work. On Tuesday alone, the US recorded 2,751 deaths. Most health experts say we are weeks, if not months, away from ending social-distancing restrictions.  <br><br>But recently, many conservatives have sided with the \"Open it Up\" protesters. In the process, they've made some very unconservative arguments.  <br><br>\"There is no zero-harm choice here,\" Rep. Trey Hollingsworth of Indiana said recently, to take one example.  <br><br>\"We are going to have to look Americans in the eye and say 'we are making the best decision for the most Americans possible,' and the answer to that is to get Americans back to work.\"  <br><br>Hollingsworth later walked back his comments, but he is not alone. <br><br>\"There are things more important than living,\"  Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick said on Tuesday. Last month Patrick suggested elderly Americans might be \"willing to take a chance\" on their survival for the country's economic health.  <br><br>This kind of moral calculus reflects an unpleasant truth about utilitarianism. <br><br>\"When undergrads are first introduced to utilitarianism, they're like, 'This is really cool. I am a Utilitarian,'\" said Jim A.C. Everett, a moral psychologist in England.  <br><br>\"But then you walk them through the implications of the philosophy, and they say, 'Oh no no no.'\"  <br><br>Utilitarianism began as an equalizing force  <br><br>Utilitarianism started as an equalizing force in utterly unequal 18th century England, challenging the idea that princes should be treated better than paupers.  <br><br>Moral philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill argued that our well-being should matter equally, regardless of social status.  <br><br>There are several variations of utilitarianism, but to put it simply, the idea is the morally correct choice is the one that  produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\" Other ethical considerations and responsibilities don't matter, not even natural rights, which Bentham called \"nonsense on stilts.\" <br><br>The benefit of utilitarianism, said Everett, a professor of moral psychology at Kent University in England, is that it can expand our circle of caring. The philosophy asks us to set aside personal biases and think about the good of all.  <br><br>Utilitarianism can also be extremely helpful for fairly allocating scarce resources among large groups of people, and so is used often by bioethicists and health care experts. Italy, a country rooted in Catholicism, has used a utilitarian model to decide which Covid-19 patients would get its limited number of ventilators.  <br><br>Most of us apply some form of utilitarianism In our lives, when we try to weigh the consequences of our actions. When we donate money to a charity, for example, we often choose one we think will do the most good for the most people. And utilitarians often argue that the wealthy should give far more than they do.  <br><br>Why some philosophers believe it should apply to the pandemic <br><br>Peter Singer, the world's most famous utilitarian philosopher, says we have moral imperative to end poverty.    <br><br>In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, Singer argues that saving lives should be weighed against the harmful effects of the lockdown, not just on the economy but on people's health and well-being.  <br><br>The Great Recession in 2008, for example, led to increases in suicide and deaths from preventable cancer, according to studies published in The Lancet, a leading medical journal.  <br><br>\"It pains us to say it,\" Singer wrote in a recent column with fellow moral philosopher Michael Plant, \"but US President Donald Trump is right. We can't let the cure be worse than the disease.\"  <br><br>Singer is a strange moral bedfellow for American conservatives. He's taken a sharp stance against the \"sanctity of life,\" describing it as an idea fit for \"know-nothing religious fundamentalists.\"  <br><br>Why some believe it shouldn't <br><br>To be sure, not everyone arguing to reopen the economy is doing it because they embrace utilitarianism.  <br><br>Quite a few anti-lockdown protesters have made libertarian arguments, waving yellow \"Don't Tread on Me\" flags and insisting on their rights as \"sovereign citizens.\" <br><br>But both stances ignore important moral responsibilities, said Allen of Obama's bioethics committee, which produced detailed reports on topics like the ebola outbreak. <br><br>Allen, now a provost at the University's of Pennsylvania's law school, said the committee would have likely helped guide the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>But President Trump has apparently decided not to name one, breaking a presidential tradition that dates to Gerald Ford in the 1970s.  <br><br>\"There's a reason every president before Trump had a bioethics board,\" Allen said. <br><br>Echoing other bioethicists, Allen said utilitarianism can be helpful in drawing up public policy, especially when trying to estimate potential costs and benefits. But in a pandemic, the moral philosophy can lead to immoral actions, she said.  <br><br>\"There seems to be an implication that we can do a cost/benefit analysis about how many people we are willing to sacrifice in order to get the economy going.\"  <br><br>Such a sacrifice won't be distributed equally. Studies have shown that Covid-19 disproportionately strikes minorities, the elderly and the poor.  <br><br>For example, black workers comprise about 12% of the American labor force but make up a much larger percentage in \"essential services,\" like grocery stores, public transit, the postal service and large retailers like Amazon.  <br><br>Basic fairness, Allen said, requires that we consider the impact on their lives and the many other frontline workers who will risk contagion if and when the country is reopened.  <br><br>\"When you think about re-opening the economy, we are not just saying 'some people' will be sacrificed for the greater good,\" Allen said. \"We are accepting that it will have a particularly hard impact on those communities.\"  <br><br>Some think we don't know enough yet <br><br>To some extent, we are already making those trade-offs.  <br><br>Curtailing our individual freedoms to \"flatten the curve\" of the novel coronavirus could be considered a massive experiment in utilitarianism, said Julian Savulescu, a philosopher and director of Oxford University's Center for Practical Ethics.  <br><br>But for the most part, we don't know enough about this new virus to make a good utilitarian argument, Savulescu said.  <br><br>For example, models that seek to predict the death toll from Covid-19 in the United States have been disconcertingly varied.  <br><br>\"The reality is that if you are in a state where the lockdown is relaxed, you might be better or worse off,\" Savulescu said.  <br><br>\"The only way utilitarianism works is in conjunction with scientific research.\"  <br><br>A big problem with utilitarianism <br><br>One of the biggest problems with utilitarianism is the ease with which it treats individual lives as mere means for social ends. <br><br>Consider one famous thought experiment: Would you kill one healthy person to save the lives of five others who desperately need organ transplants?  <br><br>Utilitarianism argues yes, for the greater good, the one should be killed for the five.   <br><br>\"It jars our common sense,\" said Savulescu. \"People feel a tension and don't know how to resolve it.\"  <br><br>Now the pandemic is forcing doctors, nurses and policy experts to face this thought experiment in real life.  <br><br>\"The question is staring us in the face,\" said the Oxford philosopher. \"Every day is judgment day.\"  <br><br>The idea of harming an innocent person, for any reason, abhors most of us, no matter our ethical stance.  <br><br>For Trey Hollingsworth, the Indiana congressman, it's a centerpiece in his stance against abortion. In 2017, he denounced Roe. v. Wade, calling the lives of the unborn \"gifts from God\" and pledging to do all he can to \"continue fighting for the sanctity of life.\"  <br><br>The point here is not to play \"gotcha.\" It's to expose the moral inconsistency in considering some lives worth fighting for, while abandoning others for the good of \"most Americans.\" <br><br>If unborn life is sacred, then so is all life, including the lives made more vulnerable when we go back to work. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

Tucked near the bottom of the list, right above a warning that bars should stay closed, was a curious inclusion: gyms. <br><br>While an integral part of many Americans' routines, gyms and fitness clubs would seem to present a particular risk for contact spread of a contagious virus. Filled with people sweating and breathing hard, sharing equipment and spaces, gyms are in many ways the last kind of business to prioritize during a deadly pandemic. <br><br>Their inclusion follows a last-minute lobbying push by an industry not known for flexing its muscles in Washington. While not every major company was part of the effort, conversations with 10 leaders in the fitness-club business reveal an influential network of relationships that kicked into gear over the past few weeks and helped move gyms to the front of the line -- even to the surprise of many in the industry. <br><br>  <br><br>Noteworthy figures in events leading up to the President's announcement include a Trump-loving fitness-center owner in Pennsylvania, Rudy Giuliani's son Andrew, billionaire real-estate mogul Steve Ross and the US Surgeon General. <br><br>Among the most influential advocates is an Iranian-born founder of one of the country's largest fitness club chains, Bahram Akradi of Life Time Fitness. Akradi has been pitching governors and the Trump administration on what he calls a \"comprehensive, multifaceted tactical plan\" to fight the coronavirus and rebuild the economy. He now finds himself on one of Trump's economic recovery working groups and in conference calls with the President himself, including on the day before Trump released his new guidelines. <br><br>Multiple people at fitness-center companies -- from executives at giants like Gold's Gym to independent health clubs --  told CNN they did not expect gyms to be mentioned in reopening plans from either the Trump administration or Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who announced Monday fitness centers were included in several public-space business that could begin reopening by the end of the week. <br><br>\"We just really lucked out and were able to get our message into a couple of the right people's hands,\" said Meredith Poppler, a top official at the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, the industry's main trade group.  <br><br>Poppler told CNN that in recent weeks IHRSA, which receives funding from many of the brand-name gym companies, began a full-court press to deal with the economic fallout hitting gyms and fitness clubs. That included hiring more lobbyists and aggressively pressing its message about the importance of physical fitness during a pandemic to lawmakers in Washington as well as officials in the Trump administration. <br><br>The messaging worked even better than they'd hoped. <br><br>\"We were as surprised as anyone when we saw President Trump announce the three phases and that gyms were in the first phase,\" said Poppler. <br><br>Connections in the White House <br><br>The day before Trump announced his plan at his daily press briefing, the President had a conference call with 16 executives from various industries to talk about reopening the country. On the call were Akradi and Ross, who in addition to his real-estate empire is a part owner of luxury fitness companies Equinox and SoulCycle -- an outsized presence for the relatively small fitness-club industry. <br><br>Akradi insists there was no talk on that call about including gyms in the first group of opened businesses. <br><br>\"Everybody talked about their employees, taking care of their people,\" Akradi said. \"We never discussed gyms.\" <br><br>A spokesman for Ross confirmed Akradi's account. \"Stephen Ross never discussed gyms, exercise clubs or anything like that with the President and any implication otherwise is factually incorrect garbage,\" said Jon Weinstein of Related Companies, the real estate firm founded and partially owned by Ross. <br><br>  <br><br>Another key figure is Jim Worthington, a board member at IHRSA and something of a Trump superfan. The owner of two gyms in Pennsylvania and one in New Jersey, Worthington was tapped for a spot on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition back in 2018. He is also the founder of the PAC People4Trump, whose website features photos of Worthington at the President's inauguration in January 2017. <br><br>In an interview, Worthington told CNN he has been working with several people within the administration on gym-related issues. The first is Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor (and Trump attorney) Rudy Giuliani. Andrew is an official in the White House Office of Public Liaison, and Worthington says he worked with Giuliani to try to allow large, multi-location health clubs to qualify for a similar exception afforded to chain restaurants in the recently passed small-business payer protection loan program. (Worthington says the issue is one Congress, not the White House, has to resolve.) <br><br>Worthington said he has communicated his concerns about the industry through Kristina Harder, the executive director on the presidential fitness council and a former top aide to Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir. According to a former Health and Human Services official, Harder is also close with the team around Ivanka Trump. <br><br>On behalf of IHRSA, Worthington has also been emailing with Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General, for feedback on guidelines health clubs should follow to ensure they're in compliance with CDC regulations. A spokeswoman for the Surgeon General confirmed that Adams told Worthington he would be \"happy to review\" any such guidelines. <br><br>Worthington said he can't take full credit for the inclusion of gyms in Phase One. <br><br>\"I think it's been a collective effort,\" he told CNN. \"I think there's been a handful of people and not just patting myself on the back, but I may be one of them.\" <br><br>IHRSA was thrilled with the move, calling it a \"small victory\" for a relatively small industry that makes just $32 billion a year. The group even wrote a letter on Apr. 17 to President Trump saying they were \"eternally grateful\" for the move. Worthington and Joe Moore, IHRSA's president, signed the letter. <br><br>A challenge for gyms <br><br>There are some with serious concerns that gyms that open in Phase One could become vectors for the virus just as the outbreak might otherwise be winding down. One of them is Dr. Saju Mathew, a family medicine specialist in Atlanta, Georgia who studied public health at Emory University. <br><br>\"How are they going to make sure that people work out where they're six feet apart from each other at all times? Are they going to only let people stagger in? I just have a lot of health and safety concerns. And then locker rooms could be even a bigger issue,\" Mathew told CNN. <br><br>Many of the gym executives that spoke to CNN said they have been busy planning how they will reopen and trying to do so carefully. The accelerated timeline in Georgia, they said, means many are unlikely to be ready to reopen facilities there on Friday. A spokesperson for Planet Fitness told CNN there is \"no set date\" for reopening their clubs in Georgia or elsewhere around the country. Orangetheory Fitness will reopen some franchised Georgia locations on May 11, the company confirmed to CNN in a statement. <br><br>The executive chairman of Equinox Group, Harvey Spevak, told CNN's Cristina Alesci the company will not open their SoulCycle studios in Georgia on Friday, when the restrictions on gyms lift in that state. Spevak said the company is working with outside infectious disease experts who will help the company make decisions on reopening. <br><br>  <br><br>And some executives who spoke to CNN expressed some hesitance at a lack of federal guidance dictating what measures they should follow when they reopen. Adam Zeitsiff, the CEO of Gold's Gym, said that even in Mongolia, where Gold's Gym also operates, the government has mandated distances between members, a quota capacity for gyms and guidelines about testing employees. <br><br>\"There still hasn't been a final guideline given to us as to how we're going to reopen,\" Zeitsiff said. <br><br>Every gym executive CNN spoke with said they had been working to develop company-wide standards for cleaning and social distancing measures to keep members safe when they do reopen. Zeitsiff said that during Phase One, employees will be asked to wear a mask and gloves, and people will be assigned to monitor who is using what machine \u2014 going in and cleaning after members clean themselves. They also plan to temperature check employees.  <br><br>Other gym conglomerates like Planet Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness said they plan to use their company app to check people into their clubs with less contact between members and employees, including eliminating touch-screen check-in machines. 24 Hour Fitness said they plan to open their gyms in 60-minute sessions through the day, followed by a 30-minute closed gym cleaning period, according to a statement they provided to CNN. <br><br>Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Global, said part of their procedures when reopening will be to use the gym app in order to limit class sizes for group fitness classes. He said they are also considering using it to check members in. Since closing Crunch gyms, Rowley says his staff has been working on a \"37-page manual\" on their procedures for reopening. <br><br>The franchise is investing in special cleaning methods and hiring more staff to handle the increased cleaning demand.  <br><br>\"We're spending -- and this is the tough part,\" Rowley said. \"We don't have any revenue but we're having to spend money to reopen on labor, hiring new staff members, having more hours for janitorial disinfectant and buying products that are more expensive thinking about safety.\"  <br><br>Anthony Geisler, CEO and founder of Xponential Fitness which manages eight boutique fitness chains, including the popular Row House, Pure Barre and Club Pilates, said he believes boutique fitness studios are safer to reopen than big gym franchises, because they are often smaller spaces and that it will be easier to track people taking classes if someone were to become sick. <br><br>\"There's a massive difference between a 'gym' like a 40,000 big box facility and 1,000 square foot Pilates studio,\" Geisler told CNN. <br><br>Mathew said gyms with large numbers of people coming in and out of the building is likely \"going to be a huge health hazard.\" <br><br>\"You can imagine in a gym setting, if you just traced people from weight to weight, if one person is infected, he or she can infect three or four people around them and then the chain begins,\" Mathew said. <br><br>CORRECTION AND UPDATE: This story has been corrected to accurately state Harvey Spevak's title and Steve Ross' ownership stake in the Equinox Group. It also has been updated to include new comments about Ross' phone call with President Trump and to clarify that he was not directly involved in IHRSA's formal lobbying effort. <br><br>CNN's Laura Robinson and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this story. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "171", "title": "Egypt's soap operas defy a deadly virus for Ramadan prime time.

CNN's KFile used the Internet Archive's \"The Wayback Machine\" to review more than 1300 deleted tweets and retweets from late February to early April many of which were regarding the rapidly spreading coronavirus. <br><br>While he occasionally weighed in with praise for public officials or more straightforward observations, tweets from this period are also littered with conspiracy theories and controversial language to go after perceived critics of the Trump administration. <br><br>In a series of tweets on March 12, Caputo responded to a baseless conspiracy theory that the United States brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, China, by tweeting that \"millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters.\"  <br><br>He followed up at another user, \"Don't you have a bat to eat?\" and tweeted at another user, \"You're very convincing, Wang.\" <br><br>After publication, Caputo responded to CNN's request for comment by saying that reporting on his past tweets is \"fair game, dude. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me at all.\" He claimed that he deletes his tweets \"every month and I do it because it drives people mad.\"  <br><br>He added \"when you tweet in spirited fashion, KFile is going to have them. I've known that all my days. So I don't mind what you've done.\" Caputo defended his past Twitter behavior saying he was \"a defender of the President\" tweeting in a \"spirited manner\" that included calling out reporters, but he said he's \"now a servant of the American people and some might be disappointed, but my tweets will be different.\" <br><br>Spokespeople for HHS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment.   <br><br>Caputo also used his Twitter account to aggressively attack Democrats and the media.  <br><br>In March, he referred to one White House reporter as \"a dick\" after that reporter had a heated exchange with the President. He said many Americans viewed reporters as \"the enemy of the people\" for \"carrying water for the Chinese Communist Party.\" He implied that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was guilty of sedition.  <br><br>On March 8, he said a Democrat may try to inflict hundreds of thousands of American deaths from the coronavirus, creating a hypothetical scenario comparable to James Hodgkinson, the anti-Trump man who shot House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise and four others during a Republican congressional baseball game practice in 2017. <br><br>\"Coronavirus is the Democrats' new Russia, their new Ukraine. And nobody will believe them except their zombies. But know this: The Dems' strategy to defeat @realDonaldTrump requires 100s of thousands of American deaths. Will one of their nutjobs make it happen, a la Hodgkinson?\" <br><br>That same day, Caputo retweeted conservative actor Nick Searcy saying, \"Democrats are pulling for the virus to kill a lot of people.\" <br><br>In other tweets from March, Caputo claimed the media created \"intentional\" panic created around the outbreak, saying it was \"orchestrated by soulless Trump critics who seize every crisis as an opportunity to stop him.\" <br><br>Caputo is a friend of political operative and Trump associate Roger Stone, leading a campaign to have Stone pardoned after he was found guilty of lying to Congress, obstructing a congressional inquiry and witness tampering after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation brought charges against him. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison in February.  <br><br>Caputo was also interviewed by Mueller prosecutors and testified before Congress, and adamantly denied there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  <br><br>Caputo resigned from the 2016 Trump campaign after he tweeted \"Ding Dong the witch is dead\" following the news that its campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had been fired. <br><br>Here are some of Caputo's deleted tweets pertaining to the unfolding health crisis in the United States: <br><br>February 28: Caputo tweets, \"Bottom line, a lot of Americans have to get sick and die for coronavirus to tank the Trump economy. The Democrats' only hope for 2020 victory is a sunk economy. They're talking it down right now. But their strategy only works if a lot of Americans get sick and die.\" <br><br>March 8: Caputo tweets, \"Coronavirus is the Democrats' new Russia, their new Ukraine. And nobody will believe them except their zombies. But know this: The Dems' strategy to defeat @realDonaldTrump requires 100s of thousands of American deaths. Will one of their nutjobs make it happen, a la Hodgkinson?\" <br><br>March 8: Caputo retweets a tweet from the conservative actor Nick Searcy that read, \"Democrats are pulling for the virus to kill a lot of people.\" <br><br>March 8: Caputo tweets a screenshot of a Washington Post story, \"How the Trump administration lost control of the coronavirus crisis.\" \"The Get Trump Media has shifted gears again: from the Russia Hoax to the Ukraine hoax to this. REMEMBER: Coronavirus is serious. The media is not.\" <br><br>March 11: Caputo tweets in a chain on testing shortages, \"A lot of the panic is orchestrated by soulless Trump critics who seize every crisis as an opportunity to stop him. And fail.\" Still, Caputo acknowledged that the lack of testing was an issue. <br><br>March 11: Caputo tweets, \"For the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, 100,000+ Americans have to die. For the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, you have to believe the media. Media literacy is more vital now than ever. Question everything - smell the BS - start by doubting anonymous sources.\"  <br><br>He follows up in a tweet saying, \"There must be a national pandemic tragedy for the Democrats to win. They're counting on it now.\" <br><br>March 12: Caputo tweets in response to the baseless conspiracy that the US brought coronavirus to Wuhan that, \"Sure, millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters but some foreigner snuck in a bottle of the good stuff. That's it.\" He follows up, \"Don't you have a bat to eat?\" He tweets at another user, \"You're very convincing, Wang.\" <br><br>March 13: Caputo tweets that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is an \"*asshat.\"  <br><br>March 14: Caputo tweets, \"100s of thousands must die and the US economy must collapse for the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to succeed. They're getting so excited for the carnage. Sick people.\"  <br><br>He follows up, \"Of course he has\" -- in response to Trump being proactive. \"This Democrat strategy, echoed by their conjugal media, will fail. Hoping your country fails and hundreds of thousands die so you can gain power is a sick and twisted strategy. America will punish them.\" <br><br>March 14: Caputo tweets, \"Taking down names of progs who pick out of context phrases from Administration statements so they can 'LOL' for resistance cred while Washington deals with a pandemic. These are the biggest assholes. Hugest shitbags. Gargantuan sphincters.\" <br><br>March 15: Caputo tweets a reference to a conspiracy about George Soros, the prominent philanthropist and Democratic donor. \"Are you kidding? Soros's political agenda REQUIRES a pandemic.\" Soros is the subject of numerous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories fueled by extremists and in 2018 a pipe bomb was sent to his home in New York state. <br><br>March 15: Caputo tweets at Daniel Goldman, a lawyer for House Democrats during impeachment, \"Wow. I started out feeling badly for you. At least now we know the Wuhan Virus doesn't have any lingering effects on douchebags.\"  <br><br>Goldman had tested positive for coronavirus and had tweeted, \"One final note: I may be the first you know who tested positive, but I won't be the last. Let's take care of each other, listen to the experts and the cities, states and corporations who are taking the lead in the absence of the fed government, and get through this together. END.\" <br><br>March 16: Caputo tweets in response to a tweet noting the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost all its gains since Trump took office, \"The Democrat celebration of the death and destruction will be held soon.\" <br><br>March 17: Caputo tweets, \"#ChineseVirus\" 20 times in a row. President Trump in March began calling the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus.\"  <br><br>Trump claimed he did so to counter conspiracy theories from Chinese media and an official that the US brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. Trump claimed he also did so because it was \"accurate... it comes from China, that's why.\" Trump denied that it is a racist term. Critics alleged the President did so to deflect blame from his own administration's preparation failures. Trump subsequently decided to pull back from associating the coronavirus' name with China. <br><br>March 17: Caputo tweets, \"The Chinese Communist Party has always been adept at lying to cover their murders. What's remarkable here is the US Democrats and their conjugal media repeating CCP propaganda because they hate Trump more than they love America. The Wuhan virus has exposed them.\" <br><br>March 17: Caputo tweets claiming there is \"intentional media panic.\"   <br><br>\"Saying the intentional media panic doesn't exist is dishonest. Saying everything in this crisis transpires because of intentional media panic is also dishonest,\" writes Caputo. <br><br>March 17: Caputo tweets a conspiracy that implies economist David Rothschild is a member of the European Rothschild family calling him, \"an inbred elitist sphincter whose family craves control. That's one reason why he constantly lies about President Trump.\"  <br><br>Rothschild told CNN he is not related to the banking family, which is frequently the target of anti-Semitic conspiracies. <br><br>March 18: Caputo tweets, \"Double down on #ChineseVirus. Leftists lost the true meaning of 'racism' long ago.  And polls show they've beaten this dead horse so badly that GOP, independent, and soft Dem voters ignore them.\" He adds, \"Nobody should let Democrats and their conjugal media popularize Chinese Communist Party talking points. Democrats + Media = CCP.\" <br><br>March 18: Caputo tweets after a reporter asks Trump why he calls it the \"Chinese Virus,\" \"And they wonder why many consider them now the enemy of the people. Carrying water for the Chinese Communist Party is reason enough.\" <br><br>March 20: Caputo tweets at Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut to, \"Try to support America until this is over. Even you can do it.\" Murphy had tweeted complaints about how long it would take to receive the order of facemasks, blaming the Trump administration. Murphy cited a February 5 tweet he sent after a Congressional briefing saying the Trump administration was not taking coronavirus \"seriously enough.\" <br><br>March 20: Caputo tweets at another Twitter user, \"I know you want millions to die so your addled candidate can stumble into the White House but it looks like you might be disappointed. How sad for you.\" Caputo had sent a tweet that cited a report from Fox News to claim Washington was flattening the pandemic curve and the Twitter user had asked for a link to the information.  <br><br>March 20: After President Trump ripped into NBC News reporter Peter Alexander for asking Trump what he had to say to Americans who were scared of the virus, Caputo criticized the media for defending Alexander: \"the media is showing their asses to the world again, wringing their hands over a hack reporter's treatment.\" <br><br>When one of Caputo's followers pushed back and said that his question was legitimate, Caputo responded by saying, \"Listen to his entire interaction including his first comment/question. Also: this guy has been a dick for awhile.\" <br><br>Alexander began his exchange with Trump by asking whether he was giving Americans \"false hope\" by promoting unproven coronavirus drugs. <br><br>March 20: Caputo tweets in an exchange on Hollywood elite, \"They understand the Chinese authorities caused this global crisis, but they hate Pres Trump more than they love America. Anyone who once doubted that now knows its true.\" <br><br>March 21: Caputo sends a tweet that implies MSNBC host Scarborough is committing treason, \"300M? That's just foolish. As our nation is in crisis you're working hard to make the situation worse. There's a word for that. Do you know it? It rhymes with sedition.\" Scarborough tweeted about a lack of testing for 300 million Americans.  <br><br>Scarborough told CNN in an email, \"I'm more interested in what the assistant Secretary does in the future than what he may have tweeted about me in the past. We're facing difficult times ahead and I am hopeful that the president's entire team will  simply follow the lead of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and keep America's seniors safe.\" <br><br>March 21: Caputo tweets at Gen. Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director for George W. Bush, \"You are corrupt garbage, Hayden. Spying on Americans is insidious and illegal, but you normalized it. Now you defend China after they unleashed a global pandemic. You can fuck right off. Step aside and let normal Americans do the right thing. Your time is gone.\"  <br><br>Hayden had called Richard Grenell, the acting DNI director, an \"idiot\" after Grenell tweeted, \"The one who started the fire should never be praised for acting like a firefighter later\" in reference to China's role in the coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>Hayden told CNN in an email, \"Michael Caputo fits right in to this administration.  He is a typical Trump thug. By the way, I never replied to his tweet but this now seems like the appropriate time to point out that he will not be a 'normal American' doing the right thing in any position in this administration.\" <br><br>March 22: Caputo tweets that Democrats are intentionally destroying the economy during the debate over the economic stimulus package after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would introduce its own coronavirus bill. \"Power. It's the Democrats' oxygen, and they'll destroy Americans for it.\" <br><br>Caputo had said that Democrats have a goal of \"massive deaths\" and \"economic meltdown\" to win the November elections, \"Now you see: Democrats need massive deaths and economic meltdown to win in November. With this House action, they get closer to their goal and they think they can cover their flank with 'argle bargle corporations get rich!' Normal Americans see this and will punish them.\" <br><br>Caputo follows up, \"I'm serious: The Dem strategy for 2020 victory requires that @realDonaldTrump fail in his fight against the Chinese virus.Failure is measured in deaths and economic collapse. The only questions to ask a Dem are how many Americans must die, how many families must be destroyed?\" <br><br>March 22: Caputo quote tweets a user, adding he is \"right you know\" to say Democrats hope no treatment for coronavirus works. \"They are literally cheering on the deaths of Americans and the destruction of our economy. They would rather see people die than see Trump successfully navigate this disaster,\" the tweet said.  <br><br>\"How many Americans must die to feed Democrat powerlust? 100K? 1M? More??,\" Caputo added. \"How much economic destruction is the Democrat goal? 100% unemployment?'\" <br><br>March 23: Caputo tweets with a picture of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the debate over the economic stimulus package, \"The Democrats have one motivation for holding Americans hostage in a global crisis: HATE.\" <br><br>March 27: Caputo retweets a picture of a smiling George Soros with the caption, \"The real virus!\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f behind everything.....\"  <br><br>March 28: Caputo tweets. \"This is how mentally ill many Trump haters are in this crisis\" in reply to a tweet that says Trump supporters will \"ignore scientific and medical experts\"  and \"urge millions to die for the glory of capitalism.\" <br><br>March 28: Caputo quote tweets MSNBC's Chris Hayes, who noted no other country on Earth was doing a worse job handling the crisis, with \"Who knew @chrislhayes is Chinese?\"  <br><br>March 29: Caputo tweets that Vice President Joe Biden is an \"empty puppet\" and Ron Klain, the former Ebola czar in the Obama administration, is a \"puppeteer\" for the \"CCP [Chinese Communist Party] virus\", writing, \"You don't see it? Let me help you. Biden has degraded into empty puppet. On the CCP virus, Ron Klain is the puppeteer. You knock out Gepetto, Pinocchio can't dance. How does a 'turd' know so much more than you?\" <br><br>March 31: Caputo retweets a tweet that says \"the Left hate normal Americans and they want us dead and replaced. Act as if they mean it, because they do.\"  <br><br>April 1: Caputo called Joe Scarborough, MSNBC, and the rest of the media \"completely full of sh*t.\" <br><br>He was appointed to his position at HHS just two weeks later. <br><br>This story has been updated with a comment from Caputo. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "147", "title": "'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic"}, {"id": "37", "title": "Trump disregards science as chaos overtakes coronavirus response"}, {"id": "92", "title": "Virus may dash Trump's plan for a 'big bang' economic opening"}, {"id": "130", "title": "Trump turns angry and defensive as evidence contradicts his coronavirus narrative"}, {"id": "145", "title": "What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic"}]}, "230": {"title": "House approves $480 billion package to help small businesses and hospitals, expand Covid-19 testing", "content": "gton (CNN)The House of Representatives voted Thursday to approve a roughly $480 billion package to deliver aid to small businesses and hospitals and expand Covid-19 testing, the latest attempt by lawmakers to blunt the devastating impact of the pandemic. <br><br>The vote was 388-5. The measure passed the Senate earlier this week and will now go to President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the legislation and indicated that he will sign it. <br><br>The total price tag of the bill is approximately $484 billion. It will add to the already historic levels of spending to deal with the pandemic by authorizing an additional $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was set up to help small businesses struggling from the economic deep freeze triggered by coronavirus. Funding for the program ran dry earlier this month, prompting an outcry from the business community. <br><br>In addition, the legislation provides $75 billion for hospitals and health care providers to address coronavirus expenses and lost revenue and $25 billion to facilitate and expand Covid-19 testing. The increased funding for testing comes at a time when there is widespread recognition that testing capacity must increase and improve as states consider when to reopen businesses and lift stay-at-home orders. <br><br>The legislation, though referred to as an \"interim\" measure by lawmakers, amounts to the latest historic effort by Washington to prop up the economy on the heels of a more than $2 trillion rescue package along with other relief measures already approved by Congress.  <br><br>House approves coronavirus oversight panel  <br><br>The Democratic-led House voted earlier on Thursday to establish a new panel with broad authority to oversee the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>The vote was 212-182, with the committee approved along party lines. <br><br>The panel, which will be a select investigative subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, will have far-reaching power to investigate how the trillions of dollars already approved by Congress for coronavirus relief are being used. It will be able to issue subpoenas, review US preparedness for the crisis and examine decisions about the crisis within the administration. <br><br>According to the text of the resolution establishing the panel, it is authorized to \"conduct a full and complete investigation\" and \"issue a final report to the House of its findings\" on a wide array of aspects of the federal response to the pandemic, including \"executive branch policies, deliberations, decisions, activities, and internal and external communications related to the coronavirus crisis.\" <br><br>Congressional Republicans have argued another committee dedicated to the coronavirus response is unnecessary given other oversight mechanisms set in place to monitor the implementation of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act and other relief measures.  <br><br>\"The Congress already has significant oversight tools at our disposal,\" said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee. <br><br>\"It's entirely plausible for one to conclude that this new select committee will simply turn into yet another partisan witch hunt aimed at damaging the President,\" he added. <br><br>Some Republicans on Thursday also raised concerns with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's selection for committee chairman, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, because he is a staunch supporter of Joe Biden's presidential campaign. <br><br>\"I respect the chair greatly. He is one of the best political minds I know. Joe Biden will tell you that,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said of Clyburn, pushing back on the choice for him to lead the committee. \"You see, our dear friend Congressman Clyburn, he should be credited for getting Joe Biden the nomination.\" Clyburn endorsed Biden before the South Carolina primary.  <br><br>Pelosi has repeatedly rebutted the idea that the committee will be a partisan exercise, saying oversight of the Trump administration's initial response to the pandemic can't wait until an after-action review.  <br><br>\"This isn't about assigning blame, this is about taking responsibility and to be able to answer for what we have put forth that it really did work,\" she said on the House floor ahead of the vote. <br><br>She added that the committee \"will be laser-focused on ensuring that taxpayer money goes to workers' paychecks and benefits and will ensure that the federal response is based on the best possible science and guided by health experts and that the money invested is not being exploited by profiteers and price gougers.\"  <br><br>The committee will consist of seven Democrats and five Republicans, according to the text of the resolution. It will probe the \"efficiency, effectiveness, equity and transparency\" of taxpayer funds used to respond to the crisis and will investigate reports of waste, fraud and abuse of funds being spent. <br><br>It will also be able to study the economic impact and disparate impacts of the crisis on different communities. <br><br>A different kind of voting  <br><br>As a sign of the pandemic's effect on the chamber, voting was be altered to allow for more social distancing and a scheduled cleaning of the chamber between votes. The Capitol physician and House sergeant-at-arms sent out recommendations to lawmakers and their staff, including to wear masks. <br><br>A number of lawmakers could be seen wearing masks on the House floor during debate ahead of the vote, but some members opted not to wear masks while speaking.  <br><br>Pelosi wore a white face covering while sitting at the back of the chamber, but she removed it to speak on the floor, then wiped down the lectern after she spoke. <br><br>At one point, House Rules committee chair Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, looked over at the GOP side where a handful of members weren't wearing masks, and reminded the members that the Capitol physician's office recommended face coverings while on the chamber floor.  <br><br>Still, a few members were spotted sitting on the House floor without wearing masks, including Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Jody Hice of Georgia, Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington and Louie Gohmert of Texas, who were all maskless for at least part of the time Thursday morning.  <br><br>In the chamber, there were signs on the chairs where members are allowed to sit, ensuring they are spread out on the floor. The galleries were empty and remain closed to visitors.  <br><br>Several lawmakers have contracted the virus since March and members have become increasingly reluctant to travel across the country to Washington, DC, for votes. But in recent days, some lawmakers, especially Republicans, have expressed unease with being away from Washington and have called for members to return to the Capitol to deal with legislative business. <br><br>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday on a call with reporters that congressional leaders were \"asking every member to return who can return, and we hope that that is a large number.\"  <br><br>What's next for coronavirus aid  <br><br>Lawmakers from both parties, as well as Trump, are already looking ahead to the next steps the federal government can take in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  <br><br>The President outlined some of his upcoming priorities in a tweet earlier in the week signaling his support for the latest legislative package.   <br><br>\"After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief ... to State/Local Governments for lost revenues from COVID 19, much needed Infrastructure Investments for Bridges, Tunnels, Broadband, Tax Incentives for Restaurants, Entertainment, Sports, and Payroll Tax Cuts to increase Economic Growth,\" Trump tweeted. <br><br>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer predicted on Wednesday that there will be a \"big, broad, bold COVID 4.\" He added that some of the Democratic priorities include funding for state and local governments, election reform, money for housing and the postal service. <br><br>It is unclear when a next legislative package could materialize, as well as what appetite there will be particularly among Republican lawmakers to continue to green-light such massive and historic levels of government spending. <br><br>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cautioned on Wednesday that \"it's time to begin to think about the amount of debt we're adding to our country and the future impact of that.\"  <br><br>He predicted the Senate will not try to pass another rescue package by unanimous consent until the Senate is back in session with \"full participation.\" <br><br>McConnell added he believes the Senate should be \"a little more cautious\" moving forward on funding.  <br><br>\"Let's see how things are working. We've never been here before. This is totally uncharted territory.

Yes, an entire album about coffee. Titled \"Foam And Flotsam,\" it features five songs that will be part of her upcoming debut album, which has 20 songs in total, she tells CNN.  <br><br>While Peretti has been working on the project for nearly a year, it just so happens that it dropped as she's been social distancing at home in Los Angeles due to the pandemic.  <br><br>\"I wish I could say that I threw [the album] together, but I spent a sizeable portion of time on it,\" Peretti tells CNN. \"We were just going to throw something together about coffee and put it up and kind of as a joke, like try to submit it for a Grammy, but then we got more and more into this album and I think we spent nearly a year on it at this point.\" <br><br>Oddly, the songs that Peretti released also speak to the time we're in, with subjects like needing a soundproof bathroom and desperately searching for oatmilk for her coffee. But she says that's purely coincidence. <br><br>\"As soon as this quarantine happened, I'm like, wait a minute, now I have to look at all these songs through this lens of quarantine and being trapped and what still holds up and what feels weird now,\" she says, adding that the songs are \"weirdly like this museum of pet peeves that if you're not being social ... that is what people are experiencing because they're trapped in their houses right now and everyone's sharing bathrooms.\" <br><br>She continues: \"I think that because the songs were coming from a genuine place, even though many of them are comedic, I think they hold up in a way, but it may be a different way than we wrote them.\" <br><br>She wrote the lyrics with producer Kool Kojak and says there are \"massive\" guests coming up on the full album, like Wale, Kathleen Hanna, Reggie Watts, Juliette Lewis, Nick Kroll, Hannibal Buress, Terry Crews, Chika, Patti Harrison, and Andy Milonakis, among others. Peretti is especially excited for everyone to hear her anthem with Richard Marx.  <br><br>\"We wanted him for this song that I wrote with Kojak and I always imagined his voice doing it and I know him from before, so I finally asked him to do it and he said yes, but then the quarantine happens,\" she says, \"We had to do that remotely, which has its own challenges. But he sounds amazing and it's like my dream because writing it, the way that the melody came to me, I was imagining his voice, which is very specific and amazing.\" <br><br>Many of the album's songs also have a video, which she filmed before the quarantine and has been editing from home since. Peretti says her influences for the visuals come from a variety of sources, ranging from the sadness in the Ryan Gosling drama \"Blue Valentine,\" to the synchronized dance moves of the Backstreet Boys and Justin Timberlake's style. <br><br>Peretti's tune, \"Oatmilk,\" is a sad yearning for just that.  <br><br>\"I wanted to do 'Oatmilk' like that cause the song was so full of yearning and sadness and I thought it would be funny for it to be really emo and sad,\" she says, \"But then we were influenced by a Justin Timberlake song. So it just started going in a very different direction from how we had initially [thought.]\" <br><br>Despite the silly feel of the album, Peretti says she actually feels pretty good about the project.  <br><br>\"I've just never really followed through in such a thorough way,\" she says, \"I also have this incredible team of people helping me. And so that also helps because I probably wouldn't have had the follow through. It was this weird thing where it just kept going and going.\" <br><br>She jokes that she's now a \"musician,\" starting her sentences with, \"as a musician...\" and deadpans that she may change the full album release date on a whim, because \"as a professional musician now that it's kind of like cool to push your date.\" <br><br>And what's up with the coffee theme? A press release for the album reads: \"Coffee. On its surface that is what this powerful and inspired concept album is about. But as the listener follows Chelsea down the caffeinated rabbit hole they will quickly lose their bearings, as 'coffee' is simply a signifier for the choppy seas of addiction, the foam and flotsam of anxiety, loneliness, shame, and mortality.\" <br><br>Her hopes for a Grammy and humor aside, Peretti says she's just happy the songs are giving people \"something to do while they're anxious or stuck in their house.\"  <br><br>\"That's, that's the best I can hope for,\" she says.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "1", "title": "Alicia Keys debuts powerful anthem in partnership with CNN"}, {"id": "28", "title": "Comedians find new ways to their audience amid the coronavirus outbreak"}, {"id": "168", "title": "Merkel warns Germany is on the 'thinnest ice' as Europe realizes social distancing is here to stay"}, {"id": "102", "title": "Being an astronaut during a pandemic: 'I think I will feel more isolated on Earth'"}, {"id": "8", "title": "Wilmer Valderrama inspired to turn the spotlight on frontline workers after grocery store encounter"}]}, "8": {"title": "Wilmer Valderrama inspired to turn the spotlight on frontline workers after grocery store encounter", "content": "Wilmer Valderrama wants to use his platform to give a voice to those being directly impacted by the coronavirus. <br><br>The actor, best known for his roles as Fez on \"That 70s Show\" and agent Nick Torres on NCIS, has started an Instagram Live series, \"6 Feet Apart,\" where he will speak with individuals from various industries on the front lines of the pandemic.  <br><br>And it all started after a trip to the grocery store. <br><br>\"I wanted to create conversations ... that unite us all and humanize a lot of the conversations that we're seeing in the news,\" Valderrama told CNN in a recent interview. \"I was inspired by that after going to the grocery store and seeing a lot of our grocery store workers feeling kind of down and deflated and as I asked questions I started realizing they were getting kind of a beating from a lot of frustrated customers.\" <br><br>Related: Swizz Beatz and Timbaland want to keep us entertained and in the light amid coronavirus <br><br>Valderrama's series kicked off Wednesday with an interview with a farmer, he plans to next highlight grocery store employees and truck drivers.  <br><br>\"I'm going to try to create an ecosystem of conversation so hopefully it creates perspective for not just my supporters but people out there,\" he continued. \"Hopefully we can lead with kindness and be a little more conscious and aware and thoughtful.\" <br><br>He also started a hashtag of the same name, which went viral. <br><br>\"I started really thinking maybe it's perspective,\" he said. \"Maybe we should think of it from a different angle.

Gavin Newsom responded Thursday to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claim that the company had delivered more than 1,000 ventilators to the state's hospitals treating a surge of coronavirus patients.  <br><br>In a series of tweets early Thursday, Musk asked Newsom to \"please fix this misunderstanding\" after the governor's office told CNN the state's hospitals had not received ventilators promised last month by the Tesla CEO. Included in the tweets from Musk was a partial list of hospitals that he said had been sent ventilators. In another tweet, he said the donations were \"based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment.\"  <br><br>\"I was not personally aware of that list,\" Newsom said at a press conference. \"I'm very encouraged that he put out that list and those specific hospitals that's where he had been sending those resources and I look forward to learning more about where they went and am grateful for his support.\"   <br><br>Ventilators? Or something else? <br><br>CNN contacted 10 California hospitals identified by Musk in the partial list of recipients he posted on Thursday. Of the four hospitals that responded, all said they had received bilevel positive airway pressure (biPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines \u2014 devices that can aid breathing and be used for sleep apnea. None had received ventilators.  <br><br>\"We received six CPAPs and we are very grateful for the gift,\" said a spokesperson for Sonoma Valley Hospital.  <br><br>Mammoth Hospital also said it received 10 bilevel machines from Tesla. \"They're not full ventilators but there are lots of people that need breathing assistance,\" a spokesperson said, calling the donation \"very gracious.\"  <br><br>Los Angeles County officials said they received from Tesla 100 bilevel units manufactured by the company ResMed in late March.  <br><br>\"They have been distributed to hospitals in our system and are being used as intended,\" said Kathleen Pich\u00e9, Director of Public Information for L.A. County Department of Health Services. \"These units are used for breathing and airway support, reducing the need for certain patients to be placed on mechanical ventilation.\"   <br><br>Musk's donation of medical devices to California hospitals mirrors his gift to New York hospitals. In that case, too, he sent biPAPs instead of ventilators, as first reported in the Financial Times.  <br><br>CPAP machines typically start around $500, while biPAP machines can be had for about $1,200. Ventilators, however, range in price from $20,000-$50,000.   <br><br>A \"heroic\" effort <br><br>On March 23, Newsom announced Musk had acquired 1,000 ventilators and would be distributing them to help California hospitals treating patients infected with the coronavirus, an effort the governor hailed as \"heroic.\"    <br><br>But on Wednesday, Brian Ferguson, the Deputy Director for Crisis Communication at Newsom's Office of Emergency Services told CNN that the governor's office had been speaking to hospitals in the state every day and to date had \"not heard of any hospital system that has received a ventilator directly from Tesla or Musk.\"  <br><br>In response to the confusion Thursday, an official in Newsom's Office of Emergency Services told CNN, \"We wouldn't necessarily have visibility on every hospital, and based on the information we did have yesterday that statement remains consistent.\"  <br><br>Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNN.  <br><br>The difference between a ventilator, a CPAP and a biPAP <br><br>In March, the US Food and Drug Administration sent a letter with guidance to health care providers treating coronavirus that said CPAP and biPAP machines \"may be used to support patients with respiratory insufficiency provided appropriate monitoring (as available) and patient condition.\" <br><br>On its website, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, said in a statement that health care workers should be cautious when using bilevel or CPAP machines for coronavirus patient treatment because the devices could increase transmission of the virus.   <br><br>\"In patients with acute respiratory failure, it may be prudent to proceed directly to endotracheal intubation, because non-invasive ventilation (e.g. CPAP or biPAP) may increase the risk of infectious transmission,\" it says.  <br><br>In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Carlos Nunez the chief medical officer for ResMed, a manufacturer of ventilators, CPAP and biPAP machines, said CPAP devices are \"the gold standard\" for treating patients with sleep apnea.  <br><br> \"If someone drops off a CPAP as a gift [to a hospital], that's a nice gesture but those should be used for people with sleep apnea,\" Nunez said. \"Hospitals will scratch their heads and not know what to do with them.\"  <br><br>Bilevel devices, he said, are \"capable of delivering ventilation\" and can be used to support patients who need help with breathing and potentially \"buy some time\" for hospitals until a patient might need more critical care from a ventilator.  <br><br>\"There are some hospitals, like in hot spots, where in the worst case scenario if they run out of invasive vents they could use them,\" Nunez said of the bilevel machines. \"I don't know if it's actually been used yet, maybe in isolated cases.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "168", "title": "Merkel warns Germany is on the 'thinnest ice' as Europe realizes social distancing is here to stay"}, {"id": "67", "title": "3D printing enthusiasts are working from home to help hospitals fight coronavirus"}, {"id": "217", "title": "Stores want shoppers to wear masks.

They believe robots and AI offer solutions that can help them bring down costs and improve store operations. <br><br>\"There's strong interest in moving rapidly in this direction because everyone knows they need to raise their game to stay competitive and it's ultimately more cost effective to automate than staff up, especially in today's labor market,\" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.  <br><br>Experts say the crisis may speed up grocers' use of robots in stores. <br><br>\"I strongly believe that the current health crisis will accelerate the adoption of robots in retail,\" said Steven Keith Platt, research director for the Retail Analytics Council and adjunct professor at Northwestern University. \"Short-term, this is to address health concerns\" of workers and customers, he said. In the long term, robots in stores will stock shelves and prepare food. <br><br>How grocers are using robots <br><br>In Washington, DC, Broad Branch Market has brought on 44-pound, six-wheel self-driving robots equipped with sensors and AI to ferry deliveries to customers in the area. Broad Branch has closed its stores to shoppers and shifted its operations to delivery and pick-up orders only during the crisis. <br><br>\"We have had them for a little over a week and they are very popular [with customers],\" said store co-owner Tracy Stannard. <br><br>Brain Corp., which supplies autonomous floor-scrubbing robots to grocers, said it saw a 13% jump in the usage of its robots at stores in March compared to a year ago. Grocers staying open during the crisis have shortened their hours to allow for deep cleaning overnight. <br><br>Walmart (WMT), the country's largest retailer and private employer, will have Brain Corp's self-driving robots in 1,860 of its more than 4,700 US stores by the end of the year. It will also have robots that scan shelf inventory at 1,000 stores and bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts by the end of the year. <br><br>During the crisis, Walmart has continued to roll out robots in stores, a spokesperson said. <br><br>The company said the \"smart assistants\" reduce the amount of time workers spend on \"repeatable, predictable and manual\" tasks in stores, allowing workers to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles. <br><br>At a handful of Schnucks Markets stores in the Midwest, Tally, an autonomous robot, scans shelves to alert employees when products are out of stock or labeled incorrectly, said Brad Bogolea, CEO of Simbe Robotics, which developed the robot.  <br><br>\"This massive surge in demand was a major shock to most retailers' inventory counts,\" said Bogolea. The robot has been helping workers restock items on shelves by giving them real-time data on which items are out, he said. <br><br>Clearing the aisles of workers <br><br>Grocers are also looking to take the process for picking customers' online grocery orders out of store aisles. Workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is costly for grocers, and employees picking orders can clog up aisles. <br><br>Albertsons, Stop & Shop and other grocers are testing small automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process. <br><br>Good for business, bad news for workers <br><br>Takeoff Technologies, one of the companies that has created these mini-warehouses, has seen a double-digit increase in orders since the crisis began.  <br><br>\"Robots handle a majority of the leg-work when fulfilling orders, meaning there is limited contact with grocery items,\" said Jose Aguerrevere, CEO of Takeoff Technologies. The process is \"well suited\" for social distancing. <br><br>Some fear that this type automation, however, will lead to the disappearance of low-wage jobs. <br><br>There are more than 15 million retail workers in America today, and lower-skilled jobs in the industry such as cashiers and clerks are among those vulnerable to technology advances. In the retail industry, \"margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice,\" according to McKinsey. \"Automation will disproportionately disrupt retail.\" <br><br>The Brookings Institution said in a report last month that \"any coronavirus-related recession is likely to bring about a spike in labor-replacing automation.\" <br><br>\"Automation happens in bursts, concentrated especially in bad times such as in the wake of economic shocks, when humans become relatively more expensive as firms' revenues rapidly decline,\" the Brookings Institution said in its report. <br><br>\u2014 Clarification: This story has been updated to describe the role of Tally, an autonomous robot that scans shelves to detect items that are running low or missing. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "217", "title": "Stores want shoppers to wear masks.

But they're in extreme short supply. That's why tech companies are stepping up to help. <br><br>The transparent, plastic headgear resembling a welding mask protects medical professionals from infection while they're treating patients suffering from the deadly and highly-contagious disease. Hospital administrators responsible for acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE) for their staff say proper face shields are even harder to find these days than the surgical masks being horded by panic-buying consumers. <br><br>For weeks, government leaders and health officials have been talking about the nation's limited supply of N95 masks and other PPE, such as latex gloves and medical gowns. But the face-shield shortage has been under-covered, argues Dr. Kranthi Achanta, liaison officer for the Washington Township Medical Foundation in Fremont, California. <br><br>\"If you have an N95 mask and you don't have a face shield, you don't have any protection,\" Achanta told CNN Business on Thursday. <br><br>3D printer makers like Carbon, Prusa Research and Formlabs 3D Systems, have recently ramped up production to help meet face shield demand. <br><br>\"Our production will go from 7,500 [face shields] this week to 15,000 next week,\" Carbon President and CEO Ellen Kullman told CNN Business on Wednesday. \"Between us and our partners, we'll have close to 18,000 face shields out. I think this number is going to grow considerably.\" <br><br>For years, Carbon and its competitors have been selling 3D printers that design and produce plastic parts more efficiently to leaders in manufacturing, aerospace, industrial production, tech, and the medical industry. <br><br>Carbon has 40 certified production network partners, including Fast Radius, The Technology House, Resolution Medical and Paragon, according to a company spokesperson. Each of those partners has a subscription to use Carbon's 3D printers and produces parts for customer companies, such as Ford Motor Company (FPRC), Adidas (ADDDF), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). <br><br>Since the coronavirus began spreading throughout the United States, Carbon and some of its customers have been adapting 3D printers to mass-produce face shields. Ford recently said that face shields made with its Carbon 3D printers were being tested at Detroit-area hospitals. The automaker said it initially plans to make 1,000 face shields per month, but wants to increase production as quickly as possible. <br><br>If the face shield shortage continues, Carbon can produce more than 50,000 face shields per week across its global network, a company spokesperson said.  <br><br>Carbon said its face shields vary in price depending on the volume it sells to each medical client. Hospitals and care providers can submit requests for equipment on Carbon's website. <br><br>Why are face shields so important? <br><br>A third of hospitalized coronavirus patients, those suffering from the most severe symptoms, need a medical tube inserted in their mouths and down their throats to help them breathe, a process called intubation, Dr. Achanta said. Intubated patients often cough and gag during the high-risk procedure, propelling spit and other bodily fluids onto the faces of medical staffers. <br><br>Normally goggles and N95 masks would be enough to protect medical personnel from catching serious illnesses like HIV, according to Dr. Achanta, but since coronavirus is so contagious, most staffers prefer wearing face shields. <br><br>\"We have two doctors and three nurses who have contracted the illness [Covid-19],\" Dr. Achanta said. \"One of them has been admitted to the hospital. ... A mask and goggles is not adequate for Covid-19. There are gaps all around the goggles that expose the eyes and elsewhere.\" <br><br>In recent weeks, Achanta said major PPE providers have focused their attention on coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey, leaving his relatively smaller hospital network near the San Francisco Bay Area to fend for itself. So Washington Township Medical Foundation's administrative team has been forced to find alternative PPE providers for its staff members who treat an average of 12 to 15 coronavirus patients per day, he said. <br><br>\"We were down to single digits of PPE and supplies,\" Dr. Achanta said. \"We reached out to Silicon Valley. Right now, without them we would be left with literally no face shields.\" <br><br>Christian Lawson, director of emergency services at UNC Health Care in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he recently ordered 107,000 face shields for his 11 hospital network, which he said has more than 30,000 healthcare employees. <br><br>\"[Face shields] are in limited supply across the country,\" Lawson told CNN Business. \"Some places don't even have them anymore. We're burning through those at a pretty quick clip.\" <br><br>Traditional face shields cost about $15 apiece, according to Lawson, who said those units must be disposed of after each use. Individual medical staffers in his network usually run through 30 disposable face shields per day. <br><br>Lawson said the kind of face shields Carbon makes can be reused multiple times after being sterilized, reducing the rate of usage to two units per day. <br><br>\"A PPE change of 30 a day, that's just burning through it,\" Lawson continued. \"[With reusable face shields] you go through one or two a shift with two nurses. From 30 to two, that's a drastic savings.\" <br><br>Lawson and Achanta said coronavirus has created a major business opportunity for 3D printer makers or their clients to permanently fill a void in PPE supply needs in the medical industry. Carbon's head of communications, Iska Hain Saric, said the company is just focused on relief efforts at the moment. <br><br>\"Right now our focus is on providing these critical medical supplies to help healthcare workers on the front lines,\" she said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "217", "title": "Stores want shoppers to wear masks.

Major chains have yet to ban those who don't put on masks, even as labor advocates push for more protections for frontline workers. <br><br>Stores are reluctant to antagonize shoppers by turning them away. <br><br>Wegmans, for example, wants to minimize \"the likelihood of conflicts in our stores\" and will \"not put our people in the position of having to deny entry to our stores,\" even in states where masks in public settings are required, a representative said. <br><br>At Stop & Shop, workers are telling customers who don't wear masks in the states where they are required to \"expedite their shopping trip, and then requesting that they wear a mask next time,\" a spokesperson said. <br><br>However, anxious workers and their allies are calling for policies ordering customers to wear masks or face coverings to protect them and other shoppers from the virus. The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if people do not display symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <br><br>\"Keeping grocery stores safe for both customers and workers means everyone must wear masks,\" said Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. \"We are urging both elected leaders and grocery chains to make masks mandatory for both customers and workers.\" <br><br>'Not the mask police' <br><br>Decisions around customers wearing masks are playing out against the backdrop of more grocery and retail workers getting sick from the virus and dying; some states planning to reopen retail stores that have been shuttered during the crisis; and mixed signals from public officials. <br><br>More than 60% of Americans report that they have worn a mask on their face outside of their homes, Gallup said Friday. <br><br>Several smaller grocers have started requiring that all their customers wear masks inside stores, yet larger chains like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Whole Foods, CVS (CVS) and others have stopped short of this step.  <br><br>\"It can be a bit more difficult to enforce this requirement in parts of the country where it's not mandatory,\" said a Walmart spokesperson. The company wants to \"avoid situations that may create a confrontation\" with workers.  <br><br>Some grocery workers believe that their companies' failure to make shoppers wear a mask puts them at risk. <br><br>\"They allow the customers to freely walk around the store without masks,\" said Dionna Richardson, a cashier at Ralph's grocery store in Los Angeles and a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Los Angeles has required that customers wear a mask or covering in stores, but Richardson said Ralph's was not enforcing the regulation. Ralphs is owned by Kroger (KR). <br><br>Richardson said she asked a customer to wear a mask, but was reprimanded by her store leader. \"I was told that it was none of my business and that I was not the mask police.\" <br><br>A representative for Ralph's did not comment on Richardson's account, but said Ralph's requires customers to cover their faces and states its policy on signs posted on the front door of all stores. <br><br>\"If a customer attempts to enter our store without a face covering, they are directed back to their vehicle to retrieve their face covering or something suitable to cover their mouth and nose,\" the representative said. \"A store leader may also provide a face mask for the customer to use, where available, for free.\" <br><br>Shifting guidelines <br><br>New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Hawaii, Miami, Austin, Washington, DC, and others have recently ordered shoppers to wear masks or face coverings in stores.  <br><br>Their requirements differ, however, and most do not come with a penalty for either shoppers or stores. <br><br>Nellie Brown, director of workplace health and safety programs at Cornell University's Institute of Labor Relations, said if a state has made requirements on masks, \"that would take precedence.\" However, \"if a state were silent on the issue, the store could make its own requirements.\"   <br><br>She believes a \"mask requirement of customers would protect employees, as well as other customers.\"  <br><br>Instead of forcing customers to wear masks, big grocers and retailers have taken safety steps such as screening workers' temperatures, installing plexiglass dividers at cash registers, adding social distancing signs and markers, and enforcing customer capacity limits.  <br><br>But a handful of smaller grocers around the country are prohibiting customers from shopping without a mask, even where it's not required, including Nugget Market, a chain of 15 stores in California. <br><br>\"I know this might upset a few of you and I apologize in advance, but this will offer all of us the most protection!\" CEO Eric Stille said in a statement on April 8. \"Extreme times call for extreme measures and I feel this is what's best to help curb the spread of the virus and protect us all.\"  <br><br>In Memphis, Cordelia's Market is requiring customers to wear masks. <br><br>\"We have a fair amount of not only customers, but also elderly employees,\" said grocery manager Angelina Mazzanti.  \"We know that we're going to have some pushback from customers.\" Customers can buy a mask or bandana at the store if they don't have one, she added.  <br><br>Smart & Final, a chain of more than 300 stores in California, is also doing this.  <br><br>\"If a customer doesn't have a mask or face covering, we politely ask them to return with one or they can purchase one in our store,\" a spokesperson said.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "128", "title": "Grocery stores turn to robots during the coronavirus"}, {"id": "168", "title": "Merkel warns Germany is on the 'thinnest ice' as Europe realizes social distancing is here to stay"}, {"id": "1", "title": "Alicia Keys debuts powerful anthem in partnership with CNN"}, {"id": "136", "title": "3D printer companies step in to fill hospitals' desperate need for face shields"}, {"id": "8", "title": "Wilmer Valderrama inspired to turn the spotlight on frontline workers after grocery store encounter"}]}, "218": {"title": "These folks have always worked from home full-time.

But you wouldn't take an hour-long personal call at the office and you shouldn't start getting into the habit of doing it now.  <br><br>\"It is really important to make it clear to other people, including friends and family, about the hours you are working,\" said Wooden.  <br><br>Define 'the win' <br><br>When a team starts a new project, make sure everyone has the same clear definition of what success looks like. With people working apart and sometimes in different time zones, taps on the shoulder or office drop-ins aren't possible. <br><br>\"It took me years when projects would fail and we'd go into post-mortem to figure out what the heck happened.

The cast of characters, however, is significantly broader, with each of the major figures taking turns serving as the focus over the course of nine episodes. <br><br>On one side, there's Schlafly, an expert on Cold War-era strategic concerns regarding the Soviet Union who essentially stumbles into becoming the face of opposition to women's lib as a branding exercise, labeling it \"a threat to the traditional American family.\" <br><br>The irony is that the mother of six, who professes to defer to her attorney husband, Fred (\"Mad Men's\" John Slattery), not only has a full-time job but is easily the higher-profile partner in this power couple. <br><br>Arrayed on the other side are the leaders of the equal-rights crusade, each of whom brings their own priorities to the cause, which serves as a source of friction. As a consequence, \"Mrs. America\" encompasses not only equal rights but race, abortion and gay rights, with activists such as author Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) insisting that standing up for lesbians will only dilute the message. \"It's not our fight,\" she maintains. <br><br>Friedan clashes with some of the other big personalities involved, including magazine founder Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), the colorful Bella Abzug (Margo Martindale, in a part she was seemingly born to play) and Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba of \"Orange is the New Black\"), the trailblazing African-American congresswomen who mounted a 1972 presidential run. <br><br>For her part, Schlafly wrestles with trying to keep her organization separate from those parts of the right aligned with racism and extremism, a distinction that become increasingly difficult to maintain. Her allies include a composite character played by Sarah Paulson, whose prominence alongside the real-life figures is one of the few faulty notes in this otherwise splendid effort. <br><br>Produced by Dahvi Waller (another \"Mad Men\" veteran, appropriately), with \"Captain Marvel\" team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck directing four of the nine episodes, \"Mrs. America\" brilliantly replicates the period, from the styles and casual sexism on display to the seemingly unlimited song budget. Steinem's looks are frequently mentioned (she's referred to as \"Glinda,\" from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" versus Friedan's Wicked Witch), and at one point a financial benefactor casually talks about her great legs. <br><br>In the process, the miniseries captures the chess match among the combatants, and the ups, downs and indignities associated with being a woman in the public square -- especially then, but in ways sadly relevant to anyone with a Twitter account. <br><br>\"No one likes feminists,\" Fred Schlafly says, sounding as if he's channeling Rush Limbaugh. \"Not even liberals.\" <br><br>The structure turns the narrative into an ensemble piece, but Blanchett is pretty astounding as Schlafly, including a televised debate she attempts to bluster her way through by making up a Supreme Court case, only to be called out on the lie. It's a particularly bracing moment considering the prevalence of such tactics now, even in this age of ubiquitous fact checkers. <br><br>Although the narrative essentially ends along with the '70s -- \"I believe Reagan is our Moses,\" Schlafly says at one point -- as the closing script makes clear, the ERA fight has continued into the present.   <br><br>While the title plays off patriotism and beauty pageants, as quality TV goes, \"Mrs. America\" earns a different kind of crown. And whenever the TV awards business gets back on its feet, that might yield some hardware as accessories to go with it. <br><br>\"Mrs. America\" premieres April 15 on Hulu. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

See how the climate crisis is reshaping life across the US on \"Road to Change: America's Climate Crisis\" with Bill Weir, Saturday night at 10 ET on CNN. <br><br> (CNN)Imagine it is spring 1970. <br><br>A few years before, Rachel Carson has written \"Silent Spring,\" a book that spotlights agriculture's dangerous overuse of pesticides and the silencing of birds and the natural world. <br><br>Stewart Brand, the still-young futurist (now 81), has been distributing buttons printed with simple black text: \"Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\" That little prompt preceded the first photographs of the Earth from space, and a sense among acolytes of Brand's subsequent \"Whole Earth Catalog\" that we humans are living with finite resources. <br><br>Turn on the TV and you might see an advertisement decrying air pollution in New York, a particularly dense smog blanket had covered the city on Thanksgiving weekend in 1966, killing about 200 people. The ad goes on to say that April 22, 1970, which will be the very first Earth Day, \"can be the beginning of the end of pollution -- or the beginning of the end.\"  <br><br>The beginning of the end of pollution. <br><br>Or the beginning of the end. <br><br>Fifty years after millions of people gathered in the United States, some of them wearing gas masks, to celebrate the first Earth Day, I don't think we've answered that question. <br><br>Putting the Covid-19 pandemic aside: April 2020 is April 1970. <br><br>Then/now: Solutions to the biggest problems we face are technologically at hand, but they're not exercised in society anything close to the scale the Earth requires. In 1970, the key environmental problems were air pollution, pesticides and water pollution (the Cuyahoga River famously caught on fire in 1969); in 2020, climate change, mass extinction, plastic pollution, and deforestation.  <br><br>Then/now: Incredible possibility sits on the horizon. <br><br>Then/now: So does the specter of apocalypse. <br><br>Only this is no longer the beginning.  <br><br>On one hand, these parallels give me hope. Earth Day catalyzed the modern environmental movement. In 1970, the US Congress passed the Clean Air Act. In 1972, the Clean Water Act. DDT, the pesticide that so concerned Carson, was regulated and greatly reduced. Rivers aren't catching on fire. There's less smog in the US today, even pre-Covid-19, pre-WFH. Earth Day proves that humans can rise to the occasion, that we can and do change. <br><br>On the other hand ... %@#*! <br><br>This month, I re-watched \"Earth Days,\" a 2009 documentary by Robert Stone that chronicles the early days of environmentalism in the United States. It reminded me of Carson and Brand and former President Richard Nixon, a Republican who created the EPA, and who, in his State of the Union in 1970 said, \"Restoring Nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions.\"    <br><br>Yet, there is one news clip in that film that really screams for attention. <br><br>\"This morning there was an awesome Earth Day warning from a government scientist in remarks prepared for the American geophysical union in Washington,\" a newscaster says, looking into the camera from behind a blocky desk. \"Dr. Jay Murray Mitchell said 'pollution and over-pollution, unless checked, could so warm the Earth in 200 hundred years as to create a greenhouse effect melting the Arctic Ice Cap and flooding vast areas of the world.'\"  <br><br>Again, this was 1970. And this clip (along with hordes of other evidence) is a reminder that global warming has been part of the national conversation for more than fifty years. <br><br>Fifty years! <br><br>It's maddening that for all of the discussion, things have gotten far worse. <br><br>In those five decades, we've dumped trillions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels for things like electricity, heat and fuel. (More than half of all industrial CO2 emissions since the Industrial Revolution in 1850 have occurred since the late 1980s, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.) Industry has succeeded at maintaining something like the status quo for a half-century, despite overwhelming evidence that the status quo kills people (via air pollution and dangerous warming, with its associated heat waves, fire, storms and so on) and is pushing the natural world headlong into the Earth's sixth mass extinction. <br><br>In 1970, the concentration of carbon dioxide -- a pollutant from fossil fuels that drives global warming -- in the atmosphere was between 320 and 330 parts per million.  <br><br>On April 14, 2020, it was 417 parts per million.  <br><br>Heat-trapping CO2 pollution from fossil fuels actually rose again in 2019, according to the Global Carbon Project. Rose slightly, but rose, nonetheless. That Arctic ice? I'm sure you've heard that it's melting. Oceans have warmed. Seas have risen dangerously, and this is just a hint -- a tiny hint -- of what scientists expect to unfold in the next 50 years on this path.  <br><br>I could go on about the dangers of this moment. That feels borderline inappropriate amid a global pandemic that's killing tens of thousands. The point is that while Earth Day did bring together disparate coalitions and catalyzed a movement in the United States, environmentalists, climate activists -- all of us -- have failed to solve the single biggest long-term problem facing humanity, which is the climate crisis, and our addiction to fossil fuels.  <br><br>Knowing that we're continually pushing the global warming problem down the road, into the future, is important. It should inspire us to act with urgency. We can do this. <br><br>But we can't go on thinking that we're living at the beginning of a movement.  <br><br>Today's climate activists are building on decades of work. <br><br>Decades of wins, yes, but also decades of stunning defeat to monied interests. <br><br>And there's far less time today -- 10 years to radically remake the global energy system and 30 to all but eliminate fossil fuels from the global economy, per the latest science. <br><br>I recently talked with Denis Hayes, the national coordinator of the first Earth Day. I asked him what he thought the 100th anniversary of that event -- Earth Day 2070 -- would be like.  <br><br> \"Somewhere between 'Blade Runner' and utopia,\" he said. \"The future is going to be one that we choose, and it will depend upon charismatic, well-informed leaders who pull together coalitions that are capable of achieving great things. It probably won't be one massive stride; it will be a series of steps ... In the ideal world, 50 years from now, a lot of people will refer to Earth Day as a celebration\" instead of a protest or a demonstration, as it's been described.   <br><br>Between \"Blade Runner\" and utopia. <br><br>That's where we sit right now, too. It's no cause for celebration. It's also no reason to give up hope. <br><br>Correction: An earlier version of this article gave incorrect statistics for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 1970 and 2020. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

While reproducing these species, scientists are discovering for the first time basic information on their biology, such as when they have babies or what their larvae look like. <br><br>\"We are losing coral species faster than we can learn about them,\" Keri O'Neil, senior coral scientist at the Florida Aquarium, told CNN.  <br><br>\"This breakthrough is just really exciting; we're still learning basic new things you'd think we've known for hundreds of years. It's just people never worked with this species before and now that we have the opportunity to work with these corals in the lab, we're going to find out so much more about them.\" <br><br>Before this discovery, there was very little information known about how ridged cactus coral reproduce. No photos, videos, or published studies were ever done on the species' reproductive biology until scientists at the aquarium successfully reproduced them while catching the \"birth\" on video. <br><br>The reproduction process <br><br>Ridged cactus corals are brooding coral, meaning to reproduce, only their sperm -- not the eggs -- are released into the water. The eggs are then fertilized and the larvae development occurs inside the parent coral.   <br><br>The parent corals \"spit out\" the tiny baby coral, which immediately start swimming around until they find a perfect place on the reef where they stay for the rest of their lives. After witnessing the corals \"give birth\" for the first time, scientists have discovered that this species' larvae is the largest they have ever seen before. <br><br>The corals first began generating spawn -- or giving birth -- in early April, and are still having babies over a week later. So far, over 350 coral babies have been released. <br><br>The next step, O'Neil said, is finding out how long the larvae swim around before settling and turning into an adult coral. This is important because knowing how far they can travel will shed light on how mixed coral reef populations really are.  <br><br>\"Conservation and saving wildlife from extinction is our foremost business focus and scientific breakthroughs that have a direct impact on protecting and restoring our natural environment is why we exist,\" Roger Germann, The Florida Aquarium president and CEO,  told CNN.  <br><br>\"Healthy coral reefs are vital to the survival and quality of life of humans and animals, especially here in Florida and throughout the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. We believe it's our responsibility to save the Florida Reef Tract from disappearing.\" <br><br>Participating in 'Project Coral' <br><br>About a year ago, the aquarium's scientists became the first in the world to get Atlantic Ocean coral to successfully reproduce two days in a row for the first time in a lab setting. <br><br>The aquarium is also taking part in \"Project Coral\" -- a program designed to spawn coral with the goal of ultimately repopulating the world's coral reefs. The project works in partnership with London's Horniman Museum and Gardens to induce corals to spawn, or release their eggs and sperm, in a lab. <br><br>Unlike the natural reproduction of the ridged cactus corals, Project Coral uses advanced LED technology and computer-control systems to mimic the natural environment of the coral to subtly signal the corals to reproduce. <br><br>As scientists continue to rescue and breed corals, more questions about these mysterious creatures will continue to be answered. <br><br>\"And just think, a solution to the next pandemic or human illness could be discovered from healthy coral reef,\" Germann said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "132", "title": "Great Barrier Reef suffers third mass bleaching event in five years"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "118", "title": "How reporters are covering the biggest story of their careers"}, {"id": "160", "title": "Moon bases could be built using astronaut urine"}]}, "42": {"title": "What is herd immunity and why some think it could end the coronavirus pandemic", "content": "The concept of herd immunity is a simple one. But achieving it? Not so much. <br><br>As the coronavirus pandemic spread throughout the world, doctors, scientists, and government leaders alike have said that once herd immunity was achieved, the spread of the virus would be less of a threat.   Herd immunity is reached when the majority of a given population -- 70 to 90% -- becomes immune to an infectious disease, either because they have become infected and recovered, or through vaccination. When that happens, the disease is less likely to spread to people who aren't immune, because there just aren't enough infectious carriers to reach them. <br><br>There are just two ways to get there: widespread vaccination, which for Covid-19 is still many months away, or widespread infections that lead to immunity. <br><br>Herd immunity by infection is not without risks <br><br>Most doctors and experts agree that allowing Covid-19 to just plow through populations might help reach herd immunity more quickly, but that would also overwhelm hospitals. More people would die, not just from coronavirus but from other infections, too. That's why we're all stuck at home -- we're flattening the curve. <br><br>\"The advantage of stretching out the number of cases is that we will not exceed the capacity of hospitals to care for those who are particularly sick,\" Dr. H. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious disease at Tufts University Medical School, told CNN's Michael Smerconish in March.  <br><br>And then there's the issue that we don't really know how immunity works with this virus. <br><br>Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the World Health Organization (WHO), said it's not known whether people who have been exposed to the virus become completely immune to it and if so, for how long. That's why governments should wait for a vaccine, she said. <br><br>The WHO has \"seen some preliminary results, some preliminary studies, pre-published results, where some people will develop an immune response,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"We don't know if that actually confers immunity, which means that they're totally protected.\" <br><br>A vaccine is a better answer, she added. \"I mean, recently we had more than 130 developers, scientists, companies come together to say that they would be willing to work with us -- to work globally to advance a vaccine. And that is something that we will push and the whole world is waiting for.\" <br><br>And while, younger people are far less likely to die from Covid-19, they can still become sick enough to require hospitalization.  <br><br>Even if catching Covid-19 once does make people immune to future infection, the US has not had enough cases to get close to widespread immunity. <br><br>\"The level of people who've been infected, I don't expect it would rise to the level to give what we call herd immunity protection,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jim Scuitto on Tuesday. <br><br>\"What it will mean, it would protect those who have been exposed, but at the community level there would not have been enough infections to really have enough umbrella of herd immunity,\" Fauci said. <br><br>As a vaccine has yet to be created for the novel coronavirus, some have argued that nations should forgo lockdowns entirely and try to achieve herd immunity by keeping the vulnerable indoors while allowing others to live out their normal lives -- and get infected. <br><br>UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed to support a similar belief back in March when he held off on banning large gatherings and closing schools. <br><br>However, Johnson later issued a nationwide stay-at-home order, effectively closing all nonessential businesses and banning public gatherings. He then contracted the virus himself, and spent three nights in the ICU. He has since been discharged from the hospital. <br><br>Why Sweden refuses to lock down  <br><br>While much of Europe has gone into lockdown, one country has bucked the trend: Sweden. <br><br>Restaurants, schools and playgrounds in the Scandinavian country are open. Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde has said it's not following the herd immunity theory, but rather relying on its citizens to voluntarily be responsible to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  <br><br>But Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, claimed herd immunity could be reached in the nation's capital, Stockholm, within weeks.  <br><br>\"In major parts of Sweden, around Stockholm, we have reached a plateau (in new cases) and we're already seein the effect of herd immunity and in a few weeks' time we'll see even more of the effects of that,\" Tegnell said in an interview with CNBC. <br><br>The strategy hasn't come without costs. <br><br>WHO has said it's \"imperative\" that Sweden take stronger measures to control the spread of the virus.  <br><br>Compared to other European nations that haven taken stricter measures, Sweden's \"curve\" -- the rate of infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus -- is steeper. As of Wednesday, Sweden has at least 1,937 reported coronavirus-related deaths, compared to Norway's 185 and Finland's 149 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. <br><br>The push for antibody testing <br><br>It's hard to tell where the US currently stands without widespread testing. That's why so many people are pushing for antibody tests. <br><br>With a prick of a finger, the tests, which aim to detect if you've contracted the coronavirus, can help public health officials determine what portion of the population has been infected and, in theory anyway, has at least some immunity to the virus, said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  <br><br>One town in California has already started antibody testing on its residents. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state, which is the hardest hit in the US, would start large-scale antibody testing over the next week.  <br><br>\"This will be the first true snapshot of what we're dealing with,\" Cuomo said. <br><br>But scientists and physicians are skeptical about the reliability of the dozens of tests that have hit the market because many have not been reviewed by the FDA. <br><br>Plus, even approved tests are never 100% accurate. <br><br>The FDA has also warned that the tests could lead to false negatives because antibodies may not be detectable early in infection. <br><br>CNN's Tim Lister, Sebastian Shukla, Nina dos Santos, Paula Hancocks, Yoonjung Seo, Julia Hollingsworth, Mallory Simon, Gina Yu, Curt Devine, Drew Griffin, Nelli Black, Scott Bronstein, Kristina Sgueglia, Augie Martin, Sanjay Gupta contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way.  <br><br>\"I have spent my entire career in vaccine development, in the government with CDC and BARDA and also in the biotechnology industry. My professional background has prepared me for a moment like this -- to confront and defeat a deadly virus that threatens Americans and people around the globe. To this point, I have led the government's efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with HHS political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early in vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections. <br><br>  <br><br>\"Specifically, and contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the Administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit. While I am prepared to look at all options and to think \"outside the box\" for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public. I insisted that these drugs be provided only to hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 while under the supervision of a physician.  These drugs have potentially serious risks associated with them, including increased mortality observed in some recent studies in patients with COVID-19.  <br><br>  <br><br>\"Sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis. <br><br>  <br><br>\"I will request that the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services investigate the manner in which this Administration has politicized the work of BARDA and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections as well as efforts that lack scientific merit. Rushing blindly towards unproven drugs can be disastrous and result in countless more deaths. Science, in service to the health and safety of the American people, must always trump politics.  <br><br>  <br><br>\"I am very grateful for the bipartisan support from Congress and their confidence in my leadership of BARDA as reflected in the generous appropriation to BARDA in the CARES 3 Act.

The world's oceans and continents sit on 15 different blocks of crust that move and shift.  <br><br>While we largely think of them as responsible for creating mountains and earthquakes, the movement of these plates also contributed to creating environments with the right conditions to support life, chemically and physically.  <br><br>Now researchers believe that plate tectonics were actively moving around on Earth as early as 3.2 billion years ago, which suggests an early evolution of our planet, according to a new study.  <br><br>Researchers have debated over the years about when plate tectonics became active, arguing over a timescale from 1 million to 4 million years ago. The reason it's difficult to find a clear-cut answer is because rocks containing information that old don't exist anymore or they've been largely changed by their environment.  <br><br>Doctoral student Alec Brenner and Assistant Professor Roger Fu, both in Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, sought out samples of rock older than 3 billion years old in Western Australia.  <br><br>\"Studying this problem is complicated by the rarity of rocks that formed more than 3 billion years ago, which today represent less than about 5 percent of Earth's surface,\" Brenner said in a press call on Tuesday. <br><br>They took inch-wide core samples from the 3.2-billion-year-old Honeyeater Basalt, lava rocks that still retain information about Earth's magnetic field. The Honeyeater Basalt is a portion of the East Pilbara Craton, a stable, thick and primordial piece of Earth's crust.  <br><br>This craton is 300 miles across and formed around 3.5 billion years ago.  <br><br>The researchers used the quantum diamond microscope, or QDM, at Harvard to study the samples. This study is one the first uses of the newly developed magnetometer technology for geosciences, Fu said during the press call. <br><br>The QDM provides context for the age of the magnetic minerals in the rocks.  <br><br> \"We are approaching this debate with paleomagnetism,\" Brenner said. \"And the premise is that rocks can record information about the direction of the local magnetic field where they form and, on the Earth's surface, this direction is directly related to latitude. So by measuring the magnetizations of some of the oldest rocks on Earth, we can get a sense of where those rocks formed and then piece together the tectonic motions of blocks of crust over time in the deep past.\" <br><br>In this case, the researchers were able to look at the record of the magnetic field in 235 different samples from the rock. Together, they showed that this part of the Earth's crust drifted about 2.5 centimeters per year 3.2 billion years ago.  <br><br>\"It's very comparable to the speeds of plate motion that we can see happening on the modern Earth,\" Brenner said. \"It's also the oldest example that we know of in which a piece of Earth's crust drifted long distances over the surface.\" <br><br>The study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.  <br><br>Early conditions on Earth <br><br>This suggests that early Earth was more similar to the one we know today. This means that early life on Earth, meaning single-celled organisms, had a more stable, moderate environment than previously believed. <br><br>When these plates move, they not only form ocean basins and mountain ranges. They also expose different rocks to Earth's atmosphere, which releases chemicals and causes reactions.  <br><br>These reactions likely helped stabilize Earth's surface temperature over a time period of billions of years, the researchers said. And that allowed life to evolve.  <br><br>\"We're trying to understand the geophysical principles that drive the Earth,\" Fu said. \"Plate tectonics cycles elements that are necessary for life into the Earth and out of it.\" <br><br>The researchers noted in their study that they weren't entirely able to rule out another possibility for the drift they measured, called true polar wander.

The telescope just happened to look in time to catch the aftermath, rather than the explosion itself, as the fine dust particles expanded.  <br><br>\"These collisions are exceedingly rare and so this is a big deal that we actually get to see evidence of one,\" said Andras Gaspar, lead study author and an assistant astronomer at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory, in a statement. \"We believe that we were at the right place at the right time to have witnessed such an unlikely event with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.\" <br><br>The study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  <br><br>Previously, the exoplanet was likely believed to be orbiting a star named Fomalhaut, which is 25 light-years from Earth. The planet was dubbed Fomalhaut b and announced in 2008 after data gathered in 2004 and 2006 suggested the presence of a planet around the star. <br><br>This was one of the first exoplanet discoveries found using direct imaging. Hubble showed the clearly observable moving dot. <br><br>But the astronomers did have questions about it. The planet showed up brightly in the visible light spectrum of Hubble's observations -- the light we can see. This isn't normally the case for exoplanets, which are too small to reflect the light of their host star and be seen so clearly at such a distance from us.  <br><br>And there was no heat signature. Exoplanets, especially young ones, usually radiate heat in the form of detectable infrared light.  <br><br>But the researchers thought that perhaps a ring of dust orbited the planet. <br><br>And in images taken by Hubble in 2014, the planet simply isn't there any longer. And images leading up to that one showed the object's brightness fading. <br><br>Lost a planet these astronomers have, as Yoda would say.  <br><br>\"Our study, which analyzed all available archival Hubble data on Fomalhaut, revealed several characteristics that together paint a picture that the planet-sized object may never have existed in the first place,\" Gaspar said. \"Clearly, Fomalhaut b was doing things a bona fide planet should not be doing.\" <br><br>So how did this bright dust cloud, which isn't a planet, disappear?  <br><br>As the dust cloud expanded over time, which was first observed in 2004, the dusty debris cloud is likely too faint to be seen by Hubble even though it's likely larger than Earth's orbit around the sun.  <br><br>And the dust cloud isn't in a typical orbit around its star. Instead, it's on an \"escape path.\" <br><br>\"A recently created massive dust cloud, experiencing considerable radiative forces from the central star Fomalhaut, would be placed on such a trajectory,\" Gaspar said. \"Our model is naturally able to explain all independent observable parameters of the system: its expansion rate, its fading and its trajectory.\" <br><br>Fomalhaut b, or what's left of it, is trapped in a large ring of debris around the star. This ring includes ice and dust and frozen objects, like comets and those that exist on the outskirts of our solar system in the Kuiper Belt.  <br><br>The researchers believe that two icy objects similar to comets, each about 125 miles across, collided. This created the bright cloud that was confused for an exoplanet.  <br><br>And based on their modeling, the researchers believe that an event like this may occur in the Fomalhaut system every 200,000 years. And they were lucky to witness the aftermath of this one.  <br><br>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, launching next year, is an infrared observatory that will be able to directly image the warmest parts of the Fomalhaut system and capture information about its asteroid belt. This is the first time astronomers will be able to get such information about a solar system outside of our own. <br><br>And, of course, they'll use the telescope to see if there are actually any planets orbiting the star. <br><br>\"The Fomalhaut star system is the ultimate test lab for all of our ideas about how exoplanets and star systems evolve,\" said George Rieke, study co-author and a Regents Professor of Astronomy at the Steward Observatory, in a statement. \"We do have evidence of such collisions in other systems, but none of this magnitude has been observed in our solar system.

Within that gas and the melting bits of the comet is information, some of which could be millions or even billions of years old.  <br><br>In December, astronomers ensured that telescopes in space and on the ground were oriented to observe the comet's closest approach to Earth. It passed within 190 million miles of Earth, shedding more gas and dust evaporating through its cometary tail. <br><br>This close (for a comet) pass was observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of telescopes in Chile, known as ALMA.  <br><br> \"This is the first time we've ever looked inside a comet from outside our solar system,\" said Martin Cordiner,  astrochemist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and an author of one of two studies on the comet that published Monday. <br><br>\"And it is dramatically different from most other comets we've seen before,\" he said in a statement.  <br><br>Astronomers could identify the gas streaming from the comet, which contained an unusually high amount of carbon monoxide -- more than has been identified in a comet within two times the distance from the Earth to the sun, according to the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.  This suggests that the comet may have formed under different circumstances than those in our own solar system.  <br><br>A second study about the nature of the carbon monoxide also published Monday in Nature Astronomy. <br><br>The amount of carbon monoxide is thought to be between nine and 26 times greater than the average comet in our solar system.  <br><br>The also detected hydrogen cyanide, which was expected and the amount was similar to that found our solar system's comets.   <br><br> \"The comet must have formed from material very rich in [carbon monoxide] ice, which is only present at the lowest temperatures found in space, below -420 degrees Fahrenheit (-250 degrees Celsius),\" said Stefanie Milam, study co-author and planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, in a statement.   <br><br>Carbon monoxide is common in comets, but the amount appears to vary. <br><br>Astronomers believe this variation might be due to the particular region where the comet was formed, or how often a comet is brought closer to a star due to its orbit. This closer approach causes it to melt and shed elements that evaporate easily.  <br><br>\"If the gases we observed reflect the composition of 2I/Borisov's birthplace, then it shows that it may have formed in a different way than our own solar system comets, in an extremely cold, outer region of a distant planetary system,\" said Cordiner. This region can be compared to the cold region of icy bodies beyond Neptune, called the Kuiper Belt. <br><br>Comets can uniquely preserve information about how they were formed because most of the time, they're far away from stars and cold enough that they remain unchanged.  <br><br>For now, astronomers don't know what kind of star the comet orbited before being kicked out of its solar system and sent into ours. Astronomers suspect the eviction occurred when the comet interacted with the gravity of its host star or a giant planet in the system.  <br><br>It's been traveling on its own, for millions or billions of years, and then entered our solar system and was spotted in August 2019. <br><br>So where did it come from?  <br><br>The comets in our solar system are leftovers from the material that makes planets, which was found in a protoplanetary disk around our sun. <br><br>The ALMA group of telescopes can observe disks around younger versions of stars similar to our sun.  <br><br>These protoplanetary disks contain gas and dust where planets pull together and form -- and leftover pieces of this gas, dust and ice form comets. So it's possible that the star this comet orbited was a younger version of our sun. <br><br>And the melting elements from the comet tell us what could be found in a protoplanetary disk around a star in another solar system. <br><br>\"ALMA has been instrumental in transforming our understanding of the nature of cometary material in our own solar system -- and now with this unique object coming from our next door neighbors,\" said Anthony Remijan, study co-author and at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, in a statement.  <br><br>\"It is only because of ALMA's unprecedented sensitivity at submillimeter wavelengths that we are able to characterize the gas coming out of such unique objects.\" <br><br>This is only the second interstellar object to cross into our solar system after 'Oumuamua was spotted in 2017.

And its signature cometary tail gave it away as an interstellar comet. <br><br>The comet won't remain in our solar system, despite the gravity of our sun, because it's zipping along at 100,000 miles per hour. By June 2020, the comet will be well past Jupiter and on its way back to interstellar space. <br><br>\"2I/Borisov gave us the first glimpse into the chemistry that shaped another planetary system,\" said Milam. <br><br>\"But only when we can compare the object to other interstellar comets, will we learn whether 2I/Borisov is a special case, or if every interstellar object has unusually high levels of CO (carbon monoxide).\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "57", "title": "The planet that never existed"}, {"id": "94", "title": "How 'Oumuamua, first interstellar visitor to our solar system, may have formed"}, {"id": "80", "title": "New potentially habitable exoplanet is similar in size and temperature to Earth"}, {"id": "93", "title": "Astronomers just discovered the brightest supernova ever seen "}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}]}, "61": {"title": "The missing link in the study of black holes? Africa Millimetre Telescope could unlock new secrets", "content": "a (CNN)Black holes, which trap light and warp the very fabric of space, remain one of the great mysteries of science. But astronomers are hoping that a telescope in Africa could help unlock their secrets. <br><br>Eli Kasai is an optical astronomer at the University of Namibia, and he is working on a project to bring a millimeter wave telescope to the country, which will be the first of its kind in Africa. Known as the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT), Kasai says it could provide the \"missing link in the study of black holes.\" <br><br>A millimeter wave telescope is designed to detect radio waves from objects in space whose wavelengths are in the region of one millimeter. These waves can penetrate the clouds of dust between a black hole and Earth. <br><br>Black holes form in outer space when stars collapse or fall in on themselves and the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. This makes them invisible to the human eye. <br><br>By using specialist telescopes to study them, scientists hope to discover more about how our universe was first formed. <br><br>The AMT will form part of a global network of telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) which has been searching for black holes in the far reaches of the universe since 2006. The existing eight telescopes combine to make one gigantic telescope the size of Earth and last year produced the first ever picture of a black hole. <br><br>It was a groundbreaking moment for astronomy worldwide because it provided the first direct evidence that black holes even existed. <br><br> With more telescopes joining the network, the EHT will be able to capture better quality photos. <br><br>\"At the moment when the existing telescopes in the network are not facing the black hole they have to wait until the Earth rotates again,\" said Kasai. \"It was this realization by the EHT scientists that spawned the AMT project.\" <br><br>With clear night skies and high mountain ranges, Namibia is one of the best areas in the world for astronomy.  <br><br>The AMT, consisting of a 15-meter single-dish radio telescope, will be positioned at an altitude of more than 2,300 meters on the side of the Gamsberg mountain in southern Namibia. <br><br>\"It's completely flat there. It's really ideal for erecting this type of structure up there,\" said Michael Backes, a colleague of Kasai's also working on the project. <br><br>The cost of the AMT has been estimated at around $20 million which includes the shipment of the radio dish from Chile, assembly and build of the power supply and data center on the Gamsberg mountain.  <br><br>Around 25% of this has been raised so far by the University of Namibia, Radboud University in the Netherlands, European Southern Observatory and The Dutch Research School for Astronomy. <br><br>The AMT team is currently fundraising for the remaining sum with the telescope expected to start observations in 2024. <br><br>Future astrophysicists <br><br>Once the AMT is up and running, Namibian scientists will carry out black hole observations in March and April in collaboration with Radboud University. The rest of the observing time will be allocated for Namibia to carry out its own research, which Kasai believes will be a \"game changer\" for the country's next generation of astrophysicists. <br><br>The University of Namibia is running a yearly scholarship program for a PhD and masters student to study astrophysics in preparation for working on the AMT project. <br><br>\"I'd love to be involved in the first video images of our black hole,\" said Hiiko Katjaita, a masters student hoping to be a part of the AMT team when it comes to Namibia. <br><br>The project is also aiming to reach 150,000 school children in Namibia through a mobile planetarium program, an inflatable dome where images of the night sky are projected.  <br><br>\"It will travel across the entire country basically going from school to school hopefully piquing the interest of children to follow careers in astrophysics and become our future scientists of Namibia\", said Kasai. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

Can you get reinfected? ", "content": "(CNN)In South Korea, health officials are trying to solve a mystery: why 163 people who recovered from coronavirus have retested positive, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). <br><br>The same has been recorded in China, where some coronavirus patients tested positive after seeming to recover, although there are no official figures.  <br><br>That raises the question: can you get reinfected with coronavirus? <br><br>In South Korea, the proportion of cases that retest positive is low -- of the 7,829 people who have recovered from coronavirus there, 2.1% retested positive, the KCDC said Friday. It is not clear how many of the people who have recovered have been tested again.  <br><br>But patients retesting positive is still a concern around the world, including in countries like South Korea where authorities appear to have brought the outbreak under control.  <br><br>KCDC deputy director Kwon Joon-wook said that so far, there's no indication that patients who retest positive are contagious, even though about 44% of them showed mild symptoms. <br><br>But he cautioned there is still a lot scientists don't know about the virus, including the issue of naturally acquired immunity. <br><br>\"Covid-19 is the most challenging pathogen we may have faced in recent decades,\" Kwon said. \"It is a very difficult and challenging enemy.\" <br><br>Finding remnants of the virus? <br><br>For now, the most likely explanation of why people are retesting positive seems to be that the test is picking up remnants of the virus.  <br><br>The KCDC has re-investigated three cases from the same family where patients tested positive after recovering, Kwon says.  <br><br>In each of these cases, scientists tried to incubate the virus but weren't able to -- that told them there was no live virus present.  <br><br>Like many countries, South Korea uses a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test for the virus. The RT-PCR test works by finding evidence of a virus's genetic information -- or RNA -- in a sample taken from the patient.  <br><br>According to Kwon, these tests may still be picking up parts of the RNA even after the person has recovered because the tests are so sensitive. <br><br>\"That's one possible and very strong explanation,\" he said.  <br><br>The same theory was posited by one of China's top respiratory experts, Zhong Nanshan. In a press conference earlier this week, he said that a recovered person can test positive because fragments of the disease remained in their body. <br><br>\"I'm not too worried about this issue,\" he added. <br><br>What are some of the other explanations? <br><br>There are other theories for why patients may be retesting positive: there might be an error with the test, or the virus could have been reactivated. <br><br>If there's an error with the test, patients may be getting false negatives or false positives. There are a number of reasons why this could happen, including issues with the chemicals used in the test and the possibility that the virus is mutating in such a way that it is not being identified by the test. <br><br>In a public briefing, Kwon said it was unlikely testing would have errors. However, he said scientists have been screening patients who tested positive again, to make sure that their positive result wasn't just an issue with the test. \"We need more further investigation,\" he added. <br><br>For now, the KCDC is investigating the remaining cases to get a more conclusive answer. <br><br>The changing results can be frustrating for patients. Jin Kim, who is hospitalized in the South Korean city of Daejeon, tested positive for coronavirus on March 25 -- this week he tested negative, but a day later he tested positive again. The 25-year-old will have to take another two tests at least, as he needs two consecutive negative tests to be declared recovered.  <br><br>Once he's discharged from hospital, the government recommends he isolates for two weeks. <br><br>Can a person who has retested positive infect others? <br><br>Kwon says there is no evidence so far of a person who has retested positive being infectious, adding: \"At the moment, we think that there is no danger of further secondary or tertiary transmission.\" <br><br>That's also a concern weighing on the minds of people in the US.  <br><br>Responding to a question about patients retesting positive at the CNN Town Hall on Thursday night, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the jury was still out on whether a person who had recovered could still shed infectious RNA strands. <br><br>\"That's a question that's still outstanding -- it hasn't been answered in the studies to date, although people are really working on that now and culturing the virus and seeing if that potential exists,\" she added. <br><br>After coronavirus patients are declared recovered, the KCDC recomends two more weeks of self-isolation. In an article published in BMJ medical journal this week, Sung-Il Cho, a professor of epidemiology at the Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health, also advised discharged patients to remain isolated or quarantined for a while to make sure there's no re-detection of the virus. <br><br>What does this mean for antibodies? <br><br>When a person is recovering from a virus, their body produces antibodies. Antibodies are important because they can prevent a person from being reinfected with the same virus, as the body already knows how to fight  the disease. <br><br>The number of recovered patients who have retested positive for the virus has raised concerns about how antibodies work in response to Covid-19. <br><br>When asked Thursday whether it was possible for someone to get reinfected, Birx replied: \"In biology, you never want to say that that's not possible.\" <br><br>She said they had seen coronavirus patients appear to recover and develop antibodies, but there was always the possibility of outliers who did not develop antibodies to the virus. \"Those outliers always exist, but right now we don't have (any) evidence that that's a common thing that we see,\" she said. <br><br>The KCDC plans to test 400 specimens from people who have been infected and recovered to see how much -- if any -- immunity having Covid-19 might give people. Kwon says those tests may take several weeks. <br><br>In the end, Kwon said, it comes down to this: \"We don't know much about Covid-19.\" <br><br>CNN's Shawn Deng and Jake Kwon contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

She's the host of the podcast \"Epidemic\" with former US Ebola czar Ronald Klain, an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN. <br><br> (CNN)At a time when politicians are dominating the national and state briefings on Covid-19, I would like to propose an alternative: Healthcare workers and scientists should be at the forefront of educating the public about the pandemic.  <br><br>We need to hear more from doctors and nurses, who can tell us what they and their patients need to survive. We need to hear more from public servants at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, who have a lifetime of wisdom and expertise. We need to hear from officials in local and state health departments. <br><br>  <br><br>When politicians, political appointees, and political pundits speak, we first ask ourselves, \"What's their agenda?\" Whether we believe their message depends on our political identity and theirs. We're poised to reject information coming from messengers we don't like, even if what they're saying is true. <br><br>  <br><br>I spent two months as a medical volunteer in Guinea during the West African Ebola epidemic. Ebola then had much in common with Covid-19 today. It was a deadly disease for which we had no effective treatment or vaccine. Control of the disease depended on basic public health measures like hand hygiene, contact tracing, isolation and testing. <br><br>  <br><br>The local politics in the region mirrored our own in many ways as well: a lack of trust in government and in the election process. Politics and government were seen as routes to self-advancement, not public service. Ebola broke out in Guinea only a year before the country's second democratic presidential elections and in the midst of much controversy surrounding local elections. <br><br>  <br><br>Early messages about the Ebola epidemic could easily be confused with propaganda. Politicians drove around in 4x4s wearing the yellow scarves and logos of the ruling party and delivered a combination of Ebola health information and political campaign rhetoric -- which, to me, feels all too reminiscent of today's White House press briefings. Angered that the party in power seemed to be using Ebola health education for political ends, the opposition party spread rumors about the origins of Ebola, sowing confusion and distrust. <br><br>  <br><br>Government officials were accused of manufacturing Ebola to maintain their hold on power. Guineans flaunted presidential declarations of a public health emergency and instructions on how to prevent disease transmission. They were cynical about the true motives behind the Ebola response. <br><br>  <br><br>It's hard to convince someone to change their values or political identity. It's a lot easier to appeal to values they already hold. They're more likely to be convinced by a messenger they already trust. In West Africa, we worked with imams to deliver the message. Dr. Mamadou Lamine Diallo, an imam and physician, explained to me that there's a lot in religious texts that relates to the control of infectious diseases. He told me, \"It is me, Allah, who sends the disease and the treatment. ... He who leads to the loss of one life is he who kills all humanity. He who saves one life saves all humanity.\" By drawing on those religious texts, imams reframed the conversation about Ebola in a way that transcended time and present-day politics. <br><br>  <br><br>In the United States, we're as politically polarized as we've ever been. But there is one value all Americans share regardless of their politics, and that value is freedom. We can't be free when half our country is sick. We can't be free when we fear leaving our homes. We can't be free when we're losing our livelihoods. We can't be free when we can't safely go to the polls to vote. <br><br>  <br><br>Freedom is what made American science the greatest in the world. And science is what made the United States the most powerful nation on earth. A number of our Founding Fathers, like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, were scientists or trained in the sciences. In the twentieth century, scientists from all over the world fled oppressive political regimes to come here. <br><br>  <br><br>Just as religion helped cut through politics in West Africa, our shared value of freedom paired with science will help us cut through political polarization in the US today. But science is a process, not a religion or ideology. As scientists, we must be humble. We must constantly reevaluate our assumptions and conclusions. We need to keep asking questions. What sets good scientists apart is that they don't double down on long-held beliefs. They acknowledge when they may have been wrong. We need more of that in our public discourse. <br><br>  <br><br>Science reporters should be taking the lead at press briefings, and doctors and scientists should be answering their questions. Political journalists should be explaining the processes that lead to political decisions, but they should leave explanations of the science and health policy to doctors and scientists. In science we can be united as one nation. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "118", "title": "How reporters are covering the biggest story of their careers"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "45", "title": "READ: Statement from leader of federal vaccine agency about his reassignment"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the now-deleted posts. <br><br>A medical expert in Hong Kong who collaborated with mainland researchers to publish a clinical analysis of Covid-19 cases in an international medical journal said his work did not undergo such vetting in February. <br><br>The increased scrutiny appears to be the latest effort by the Chinese government to control the narrative on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives and sickened 1.7 million people worldwide since it first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.  <br><br>Since late January, Chinese researchers have published a series of Covid-19 studies in influential international medical journals. Some findings about early coronavirus cases -- such as when human-to-human transition first appeared -- have raised questions over the official government account of the outbreak and sparked controversy on Chinese social media. <br><br>And now, Chinese authorities appear to be tightening their grip on the publication of Covid-19 research.  <br><br>A Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation said the move was a worrying development that would likely obstruct important scientific research.  <br><br>\"I think it is a coordinated effort from (the) Chinese government to control (the) narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China,\" the researcher told CNN. \"And I don't think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease.\"  <br><br>CNN has reached out to China's Foreign Ministry for comment. <br><br>Increased scrutiny <br><br>According to the directive issued by the Ministry of Education's science and technology department, \"academic papers about tracing the origin of the virus must be strictly and tightly managed.\"  <br><br>The directive lays out layers of approval for these papers, starting with the academic committees at universities. They are then required to be sent to the Education Ministry's science and technology department, which then forwards the papers to a task force under the State Council for vetting. Only after the universities hear back from the task force can the papers be submitted to journals. <br><br>Other papers on Covid-19 will be vetted by universities' academic committees, based on conditions such as the \"academic value\" of the study, and whether the \"timing for publishing\" is right. <br><br>The directive is based on instructions issued during a March 25 meeting held by the State Council's task force on the prevention and control of Covid-19, it said. <br><br>The document was first posted Friday morning on the website of the Fudan University in Shanghai, one of China's leading universities. <br><br>When CNN called a contact number left at the end of the notice, a staff member of the Education ministry's science and technology department confirmed they had issued the directive. <br><br>\"It is not supposed to be made public -- it is an internal document,\" said the person, who refused to reveal his name. <br><br>A few hours later, the Fudan University page was taken down. <br><br>The China University of Geoscience in Wuhan also posted a similar notice about the extra vetting on Covid-19 papers on its website. The page has since been deleted, but a cached version of it remains accessible. <br><br>The Chinese researcher who spoke to CNN said the notice was issued a few days ago, adding that only Covid-19 research was subject to the additional checks. <br><br>David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he did not encounter any additional vetting when he and a team of mainland Chinese researchers published a clinical analysis of Covid-19 cases in the New England Journal of Medicine in February. <br><br>\"The process was really simple then,\" he told CNN over the phone. <br><br>Hui said he was still revising the draft of the paper until 3 a.m. on the day it was due for submission, and the paper was sent to the NEJM by midday. <br><br>\"There was completely no restriction at all,\" he said. <br><br>\"I don't know if it is because some researchers published something that is considered sensitive domestically in China. (I'm) not sure if it is because of the controversy about the origin of the virus later, and the non-sensitive stuff becomes sensitive too.\" <br><br>Origin of the virus <br><br>In late December, Wuhan reported the first cases of the coronavirus, linked by authorities to a seafood market in the city. Scientists in China and the West have said the virus is likely to have originated in bats and jumped to humans from an intermediate host -- just like its cousin that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. <br><br>However, parts of Chinese social media and even the country's government appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the virus. <br><br>Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly stressed that there has been no conclusion on the exact origin of the virus. Last month, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, promoted a conspiracy on Twitter that the virus had originated in the US and was brought to China by the US military. <br><br>Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations, said the origin of the coronavirus has become a politically sensitive topic in China. <br><br>\"It is no surprise that the government seeks to control related scientific research so that the findings do not challenge its own narrative on the origin of the virus and the government response to the crisis,\" Professor Huang told CNN. <br><br>\"The danger is that when scientific research is subject to the needs of those in power, it further undermines the credibility of the government narrative, making accusations of underreporting and misinformation more convincing.\"  <br><br>In China, research papers on the coronavirus are already subjected to layers of vetting after they are submitted to Chinese academic journals, according to an editor at a Chinese medical journal. <br><br>Wang Lan, the editorial director of the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, said all Covid-19 papers have to go through an approval process for \"major topics\" after being submitted to her journal. <br><br>\"It has always been the case,\" she told CNN. \"They have to be approved by three levels of organizations. It's a long process.\" <br><br>The Chinese researcher who requested anonymity said under the new restrictions, however, coronavirus research that contradicted the official narrative could be suppressed by Beijing. <br><br>\"I think the importance is that the international scientific community must realize that any journal or manuscripts from (a) Chinese research institution has kind of been double-checked by the government,\" said the researcher. \"It is important for them to know there are extra steps between independent scientific research and final publication.\" <br><br>CNN's Steven Jiang and Alexandra Lin contributed reporting. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

And it proves Einstein's theory was right", "content": "For the first time, astronomers have observed a star orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. And the star is dancing to the predicted tune of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.  <br><br>The study published Thursday in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. <br><br>Observations of the star were made by astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. They saw that the star's orbit is shaped like a rosette.  <br><br>Isaac Newton's theory of gravity suggested the orbit would look like an ellipse, but it doesn't. The rosette shape, however, holds up Einstein's theory of relativity.  <br><br>\"Einstein's general relativity predicts that bound orbits of one object around another are not closed, as in Newtonian gravity, but precess forwards in the plane of motion,\" said Reinhard Genzel, in a statement. He is the director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany.  <br><br>Genzel also led a program that demonstrated this result. The initiative strove for increasing the precision of measurements over a 30-year period.  <br><br>Special effects <br><br>\"This famous effect -- first seen in the orbit of the planet Mercury around the Sun -- was the first evidence in favour of general relativity,\" Genzel said. \"One hundred years later we have now detected the same effect in the motion of a star orbiting the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way. This observational breakthrough strengthens the evidence that Sagittarius A* must be a supermassive black hole of 4 million times the mass of the sun.\" <br><br>Sagittarius A* is the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. It's 26,000 light-years from the sun. Our solar system exists on the edge of one of the Milky Way's massive spiral arms.  <br><br>Dense stars can be found around the black hole. One of them, the star known as S2 in this observation, passes closest to the black hole within less than 20 billion kilometers.  <br><br>It's one of the closest stars to be found orbiting the black hole.  <br><br>And when it nears the black hole, the star is moving at 3% the speed of light. It takes 16 Earth years for the star to complete an orbit around the black hole.  <br><br>\"After following the star in its orbit for over two and a half decades, our exquisite measurements robustly detect S2's Schwarzschild precession in its path around Sagittarius A*,\" said Stefan Gillessen, who led the analysis of the measurements at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. <br><br>Orbits aren't usually perfect circles. Instead, objects move closer in or further away during rotation. S2's closest approach of the black hole changes each time, which helps create the rosette shape. And the theory of general relativity predicts how much that orbit changes. <br><br>A clearer picture <br><br>The theory also allowed them to understand more about the general area at the center of our galaxy, which is difficult for us to see from such a distance since it's clouded by gas and dust in our galaxy. <br><br>Observations of the star over the period of 27 years made this discovery possible. The same team also previously reported the way the star's light stretches as it approaches the black hole.  <br><br>\"Our previous result has shown that the light emitted from the star experiences general relativity. Now we have shown that the star itself senses the effects of general relativity,\" said Paulo Garcia, study co-author and a researcher at Portugal's Centre for Astrophysics and Gravitation. <br><br>Future telescopes, like the European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope, will allow for observations of fainter stars that move even closer to the black hole.  <br><br>\"If we are lucky, we might capture stars close enough that they actually feel the rotation, the spin, of the black hole,\" said Andreas Eckart, study co-author and project lead scientist from Cologne University in Germany. \"That would be again a completely different level of testing relativity.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

Now, it may be biggest hole the North Pole's ozone layer has ever incurred.  <br><br>This hole in the Arctic ozone layer reached an area of over 620,000 square miles since it was first spotted in February, said Diego Loyola, a scientist at the German Aerospace Center, in a statement to the European Space Agency.  <br><br>Ozone levels in the area have dropped steeply since then.  <br><br>That's unusual for a few reasons. While holes in the ozone layer are reported every year in the Antarctic, where temperatures are much colder, no sizable holes in the ozone layer have been recorded in the Arctic since 2011.  <br><br>Even researchers with the Copernicus Program, the European Union's Earth observation program, who first caught the hole say they aren't sure why it's so large.  <br><br>\"The ozone has been, in this layer, almost completely depleted,\" said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.  <br><br>About the ozone layer -- and ozone holes <br><br>Life on Earth relies on the ozone layer, which sits in the stratosphere between 9 and 22 miles above the Earth, to protect us from ultraviolet radiation, which is known to cause skin cancer and suppress the immune system. But human-made chemicals have been poking holes in it for years -- there's been a hole in the Antarctic ozone layer every year since 1985, when the first one was reported by the British Antarctic Survey.  <br><br>There are a few conditions necessary to tear a hole in the ozone layer. Among them are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), manufactured chemicals that have been phased out of consumer products after they were banned in 1996, and halons, formerly found in fire extinguishers, which accumulate in the atmosphere after they're emitted during human activity.  <br><br>These chemicals can remain in the atmosphere between 50 and 100 years. Because of their longevity, the ozone layer isn't expected to fully heal until the end of the 21st century, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. <br><br>How ozone holes form <br><br>When the Antarctic is cloaked in below-freezing darkness, polar vortexes can form -- those are swirls of stratospheric clouds that facilitate the reactions between CFCs and the ozone layer (holes typically form when the weather is -108.4 degrees Fahrenheit).  <br><br>When conditions are right, and the first sunlight after winter arrives, the ozone breaks the CFC bond to release a chlorine atom, which can poke a hole in the ozone layer, according to NASA Ozone Watch.  <br><br>It's much rarer for ozone holes to form in the Arctic, where the mountainous terrain at high altitudes makes it difficult for polar vortexes to form and sustain their power, Peuch said.  <br><br>But the existence of this record-breaking hole means that conditions must have been right in the Arctic. Peuch said it's still not clear why this hole formed, though. <br><br>What the record-breaking hole means <br><br>The level of ozone fell steeply in the affected area throughout February and March, Peuch said.  <br><br>As a result, the UV radiation that has made it to the Earth's surface is slightly higher than usual. But because the hole occurred in the winter into early spring, the UV index reached a high of 5, which is unusually high for this region but fairly normal for much of the United States, which hovers around an index of 5 or 6, according to the EPA's monthly UV averages.  <br><br>This hole doesn't pose a huge deal for humans, though, Peuch said. Because the UV radiation is mostly affecting northern Greenland, which he said is sparsely populated, and the exposure won't last long, the effects of this ozone hole are minor.  <br><br>One area that is of concern, he said, is how this could affect ecosystems in the area.  <br><br>\"That I cannot tell, but for human health, it's fairly moderate,\" he said.  <br><br>And the hole isn't permanent, either: Peuch said he expects it to begin to close as soon as next week.  <br><br>CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

John W. \"Jay\" Raymond, the commander of Space Command and the US Space Force's chief of space operations, said the Russian test \"provides yet another example that the threats to US and allied space systems are real, serious and growing.\" <br><br>The top Space Force general added that \"Russia's missile system is capable of destroying satellites in low Earth orbit,\" calling Wednesday's test \"further proof of Russia's hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals designed to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting their counterspace weapons programs.\" <br><br>Russian and Chinese anti-satellite weapons were cited as one of the reasons why the US needed a military branch focused on space, prompting the creation of the Space Force which Raymond now leads. <br><br>US satellites play a critical role in everything from navigation, weapons targeting and intelligence gathering, including keeping tabs on North Korea's nuclear weapons program and monitoring Russian and Chinese military activity, and there is concern about Beijing and Moscow's growing ability to target satellites. <br><br>Space Command said the latest Russian test comes on the \"heels of Russia's on-orbit testing the US highlighted in February, namely COSMOS 2542 and COSMOS 2543.\" <br><br>The statement said that those satellites, \"which behaved similar to previous Russian satellites that exhibited characteristics of a space weapon, conducted maneuvers near a US Government satellite that would be interpreted as irresponsible and potentially threatening in any other domain.\" <br><br>Yet despite those mounting tensions the US and Russia have been able to collaborate on space issues with a NASA astronaut joining two Russian cosmonauts on a mission to the International Space Station earlier this month.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

Dating the objects helped them reconstruct the timeline of when this pass was used and its purpose.  <br><br>The new study published this week in the journal Antiquity.  <br><br>In recent years, climate change has caused mountain glaciers to melt away, revealing well-preserved markers from different periods in history beneath. This is what happened in Lendbreen, Norway.  <br><br>\"A lost mountain pass melting out of the ice is a dream discovery for us glacial archaeologists,\" said Lars Pil\u00f8 in a statement. He is the study author and co-director of the Glacier Archaeology Program. \"In such passes, past travelers left behind lots of artefacts, frozen in time by the ice. These incredibly well-preserved artefacts of organic materials have great historical value.\" <br><br>The researchers believe the pass was used from the Roman Iron Age in 300 AD to the Viking Age in 1000 AD.  <br><br>Horseshoes; a horse snowshoe; the bones of packhorses; sled fragments; and a walking stick inscribed with runes all reveal the transportation used on the pass. Other objects discarded along the way include a knife and its wooden handle; a birchbark container; a wooden needle; tinderbox; a wooden whisk; and a distaff, a tool that was used to hold wool as it was spun by hand.  <br><br>Some of the most remarkable items include blue textile rags, a Viking mitten, shoes and a complete Roman Iron Age tunic.  <br><br>And some items can't be identified yet because the researchers have nothing to compare them to.  <br><br>Frozen for all this time, some of the items appear almost new.  <br><br>\"The preservation of the objects emerging from the ice is just stunning,\" said Espen Finstad, study co-author and co-director of the Glacier Archaeology Program, in a statement. \"It is like they were lost a short time ago, not centuries or millennia ago.\" <br><br>Sixty of the items have been dated so far. Based on the ages the items provided, the researchers believe that local traffic used the pass to access summer dairy and livestock farms located in higher elevations. They found small wooden bits, likely used for goats, and leaf fodder stripped from trees that could be used as a dietary supplement for livestock during winter.  <br><br>It was also a travel and trade route, transporting goods like antlers and pelts outside of Norway.  <br><br>Passage was likely easiest between late winter and early summer when snow covered the rough terrain.  <br><br>Cairns, or piles of stones built by humans, were used to mark the route. They also found evidence of a permanent shelter on the pass. The pass was used for 700 years.  <br><br>\"The start around AD 300 was a time when local settlement activity was picking up,\" said James H. Barrett, study co-author and program partner, in a statement. \"When the use of the pass intensified around AD 1000, during the Viking Age, it was a time of increased mobility, political centralisation and growing trade and urbanisation in Northern Europe.\" <br><br>Barrett noted that mountain passes acted as links to larger trading networks, connecting remote regions. <br><br>Eventually, use of the pass decreased.  <br><br>\"The decline of the Lendbreen pass was probably caused by a combination of economic changes, climate change and late medieval pandemics, including the Black Death,\" Pil\u00f8 said. \"When the local area recovered, things had changed, and the Lendbreen pass was lost to memory.\" <br><br>Fieldwork has been conducted at the site since 2011, but this study only includes the discoveries made up through 2015. The researchers said more ice has melted since then, with a large amount lost in 2019.  <br><br>More research about the final remains recovered from Lendbreen will be released in the future. The 2019 melt also revealed the first artifacts from another pass on the same ridge, about six miles to the west.  <br><br>\"When we arrived at the site last fall, the surface of the ice in the pass was littered with artefacts and horse dung,\" Finstad said. \"The remaining ice from the time of the pass probably melted out. The final melt revealed many remarkable finds, such as a dog with collar and leash, a horse snowshoe and a wooden box with the lid still on.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

Researchers recently uncovered the planet in archival data collected by Kepler.  <br><br>Kepler was retired in 2018, but its data could lead to more discoveries for years to come. Currently, NASA's TESS mission is the latest planet-hunter seeking out exoplanets. <br><br>The planet has been dubbed Kepler-1649c. It's 1.06 times larger than Earth and receives about 75% the amount of light that Earth gets from the sun. This suggests that the surface temperature of the exoplanet could be similar to Earth.  <br><br>The planet is also located within the habitable zone of its star, existing at just the right distance where liquid water can exist on the surface. This also suggests that it could support life.  <br><br>But Kepler-1649c orbits a red dwarf star, much smaller and cooler than our sun. In recent years, multiple exoplanets have been found orbiting these stars that are common in our galaxy.  <br><br>The planet is much closer to its star than Earth is to the sun. It completes an orbit around its star every 19.5 Earth days. This also means that the planet could be lashed by radiation flares from the environment, threatening any potential life. But no flares have been observed so far.  <br><br>Other than that, researchers don't know much about the planet or its atmosphere, which could shift the temperature estimate. Researchers know that another planet similar in size orbits the star much closer, similar to Venus in our solar system, according to NASA. <br><br>The study published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.  <br><br>\"This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The data gathered by missions like Kepler and our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will continue to yield amazing discoveries as the science community refines its abilities to look for promising planets year after year.\" <br><br>This newest exoplanet joins other intriguing finds that are close in size to Earth, like TRAPPIST-1f in the TRAPPIST system 39 light-years from Earth. And exoplanets like TRAPPIST-1D and TOI 700d are considered similar in temperature to Kepler-1649c. <br><br>But Kepler-1649c is the most interesting exoplanet yet that is similar in size and temperature to Earth and exists within the habitable zone of its star.  <br><br>Initially, Kepler-1649c was overlooked because a computer algorithm called Robovetter classified it as false positive. Computers can make mistakes, so researchers in the Kepler False Positive Working Group who analyze all the false positives took another look. And they identified it as a planet.  <br><br>\"Out of all the mislabeled planets we've recovered, this one's particularly exciting -- not just because it's in the habitable zone and Earth-size, but because of how it might interact with this neighboring planet,\" said Andrew Vanderburg, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and first author of the study. \"If we hadn't looked over the algorithm's work by hand, we would have missed it.\" <br><br>The researchers believe there could be a third planet in the system, although they haven't spotted it yet. The reason they think another one exists is because of the first and second planets have an orbital resonance; their orbits line up in a stable ratio. For every nine times Kepler-1649c orbits its star, the closest planet completes four orbits. A planet could exist in between the two. <br><br>\"The more data we get, the more signs we see pointing to the notion that potentially habitable and Earth-size exoplanets are common around these kinds of stars,\" said Vanderburg. \"With red dwarfs almost everywhere around our galaxy, and these small, potentially habitable and rocky planets around them, the chance one of them isn't too different than our Earth looks a bit brighter.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "57", "title": "The planet that never existed"}, {"id": "93", "title": "Astronomers just discovered the brightest supernova ever seen "}, {"id": "59", "title": "Scientists get first look inside comet from outside our solar system"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}]}, "82": {"title": "Italy aims to turn suffering to advantage with experimental Covid-19 treatment", "content": "CNN)For nearly a month, Italy held the awful distinction of having the most coronavirus deaths of any country in the world -- topping China, the original epicenter, in mid-March, and being overtaken by the United States three and a half weeks later. <br><br>But now doctors are hoping to turn Italy's terrible suffering to its advantage. <br><br>The country is pinning its hopes on using the blood plasma of Covid-19 survivors to help those who are suffering most from it in hospitals now. <br><br> \"Good can come out of this,\" said Dr. Fausto Baldanti.  \"We had such a huge outbreak, [that] now we have many potential donors.\" <br><br>People who recover from an infection, or who tested positive but never experienced symptoms, develop antibodies in their blood plasma. Those antibodies can be transfused into another victim, where they might help to neutralize the virus in the recipient's body. <br><br>For decades, doctors have used plasma or even whole blood from recovered patients to treat the newly infected. <br><br>Baldanti is a virologist at the University of Pavia San Matteo Hospital in Italy's northern Lombardy region, which has seen the most cases and deaths in the country. He hopes \"this plasma treatment can be crucial for controlling the infection in patients admitted to intensive care units.\" <br><br>That's the theory, anyway -- but the treatment is still in the experimental phase in Italy. <br><br>It depends on the development of a proven test for coronavirus antibodies -- which is not yet available. (In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration just tightened restrictions on antibody tests after an earlier relaxing of the rules led to a flood of low-quality tests.) <br><br>Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, don't diagnose active infection with the coronavirus. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system -- antibodies -- through a blood sample. <br><br>The presence of antibodies may mean a person has at least some immunity -- although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or how long it will last. <br><br>The director general of the Italian National Blood Center hopes to have a test ready within weeks. <br><br>\"We should have a serological exam (blood test) that is approved to test if someone has antibodies by the end of April. We will start selecting the first donors by the end of the month,\" Giancarlo Maria Liumbruno told CNN. <br><br>\"This new initiative would allow us to go through our 1,700,000 blood donors in Italy, to see who has been infected or is asymptomatic and has developed antibodies,\" he said. <br><br>Once an antibody test is approved, Italy plans to open its blood banks to donations from people with coronavirus antibodies, Liumbruno said. <br><br>The test would allow scientists to select the most effective blood donors, San Matteo hospital virologist Baldanti explained: \"So, who has the highest activity of the virus? You use that plasma to infuse into the sick patients.\" <br><br>The project aims to recruit repeat voluntary plasma donors with antibodies, Liumbruno said. <br><br>In northern Italy, trials have already begun at some hospitals of treating patients with plasma from an individual who has recovered from the virus and has tested negative for it for at least 14 days. <br><br>The plasma is separated from blood cells in a process called plasmapheresis and intravenously given to a Covid-19 patient.    <br><br>Plasma could also be the key to creating an effective drug therapy, according to Liumbruno. <br><br>Hospitals from the hard-hit northern region are working with Kedrion Biopharma, a global biotech company with production facilities in Italy and the United States. <br><br>It is one of four companies authorized by Italy's National Health Service to fractionate plasma from blood banks.    <br><br>It is working on a plasma-derived treatment for Covid-19 and expects it to be ready in three to six months, according to its Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Alessandro Gringeri. <br><br>\"Initially we will use plasma from about 100 patients who have recovered from Covid-19 in order to develop a dosage that can be injected through either intravenous or intramuscular means,\" Gringeri said. \"We will generate a plasma-derived immunoglobulin therapy that can be administered to either patients who are suffering from Covid-19 or health care workers to provide temporary passive immunization.\" <br><br>Gringeri says the company plans to start collecting plasma from convalescent patients by the end of May, with a hope of having a prototype of the treatment by the end of September. <br><br>If the theory proves successful in practice, Italy's tragedy may at least turn out to contain the seeds of a solution. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

House officials about antibody testing, according to two doctors who were on the call.  <br><br>Much of the news wasn't very good.  <br><br>Antibody tests check to see if a person has previously been infected with Covid-19, an indication that they've had the virus and now could be immune to it.  <br><br>Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has called such tests \"critical.\"  <br><br>The test can help determine if someone is immune to coronavirus, \"and that's going to be important when you think about getting people back into the workplace,\" according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the task force.  <br><br>\"The antibody test says you were infected and if you're feeling well, you've very likely recovered,\" Fauci said. \"As we look forward, as we get to the point of at least considering opening up the country as it were, it's very important to appreciate and to understand how much that virus has penetrated society.\" <br><br>Trump administration officials have promised that antibody tests are on their way.  <br><br>\"We have made great progress with the antibody testing, fantastic progress,\" Trump said at a media briefing April 5.  <br><br>Five days later, Vice President Mike Pence said at a media briefing that \"very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus.\"   <br><br>But on the April 6 phone call, members of the National Academy of Sciences' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats told members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy there are issues with the availability and reliability of the antibody tests in the United States right now.   <br><br>\"In three words: Work in progress,\" said Dr. David Relman, a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee who was on the call.   <br><br>There are several layers of issues with the antibody tests.   <br><br>First, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules, and now companies can sell antibody tests without submitting validation data that shows they actually work.  <br><br>The Association of Public Health Laboratories says that has resulted in \"crappy\" tests flooding the market. <br><br>\"It's like the wild, wild West out there -- or wild East,\" said association CEO Scott Becker, a reference to the fact that at least half the companies making these tests are in China. <br><br>Becker said that in conference call Tuesday that FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said antibody tests would undergo scientific review by the National Cancer Institute.   <br><br>There has been concern that some of the tests might confuse the coronavirus causing the current pandemic with one of several coronaviruses that cause the common cold. <br><br>\"Lots of tests confuse the two,\" Relman said.    <br><br>The tests would then end up telling people they had antibodies to the pandemic coronavirus when they didn't, and people might think they're immune when they're not.   <br><br>A few days after the phone call, the NAS scientists wrote a letter to the White House frankly apprising them about the quality of antibody tests. <br><br>Results from antibody tests \"should be viewed as suspect until rigorous controls are performed and performance characteristics described, as antibody detection methods can vary considerably, and most so far have not described well-standardized controls,\" according to the letter. <br><br>Second, there are good tests in the midst of the bad ones, but they're not yet widely and easily available throughout the country.  <br><br>Third, it's not entirely clear that having antibodies to Covid-19 means that you truly have immunity and won't get the disease again. <br><br>\"That's the $64 question,\" said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of the NAS committee, who was also on the phone call with the White House. \"Does antibody level equate to resistance to getting ill again?\"   <br><br>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not respond to requests from CNN to describe what it learned on the April 6 call or how officials plan to use the information the scientists gave them.   <br><br>Fineberg said he felt that the White House officials paid close attention on the call.   <br><br>\"That's the brilliance of Kelvin Droegemeier, to elicit this kind of input and turn to the academics in the first place,\" Fineberg said, referring to the director of the White House policy office. \"They're genuinely trying to widen their aperture for advice, and I think so far it's working.\"   <br><br>\"To see this kind of engagement is very heartening,\" Relman added. \"Does it lead to useful consequences? Does it have an impact? Does the scientific engagement end up informing policy? For that I think we have to hope and wait and see.\"   <br><br>Fineberg added that antibody tests are important on a national scale, to gauge what proportion of the population might be immune, but also on a personal level. <br><br>\"Everybody wants to know -- am I immune? Can I now visit Grandma so that I'm not a threat to her and she's not a threat to me?\" he said. \"How do we discern the people who can now safely go out and about? That's an important personal and social question.\"   <br><br>CNN's Minali Nigam, Devon Sayers and Julie In contributed to this report.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday it will be up to the governors when to reopen but he thought the federal government would give a date to them. Some states might open before April 30, he predicted.  <br><br>California officials during this phase of the pandemic are looking toward means of Covid-19 suppression, herd immunity and, ultimately, a vaccine, but it will be \"perhaps the most difficult and challenging phase of all,\" Newsom said. <br><br>The governor said that was saying a lot because the phase that has brought 734 deaths and new cases was very challenging. <br><br>Herd immunity is when so many people in the community have had the virus and become immune that it largely prevents further spread. <br><br>What needs to happen for order to be lifted <br><br>Newsom emphasized that reopening schools is the priority.  <br><br>\"We need to get our kids back to school.

The model predicts the US may have seen peak daily deaths on Monday. <br><br>But the model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington assumes nationwide social distancing through May, and experts are wary about the model's assumption that there will be no resurgence of the virus in the summer months. <br><br>Though US lawmakers have approved more than $2 trillion in stimulus, the International Monetary Fund said it expects the US economy to shrink by 5.9% this year --  the worst slump since 1946.  <br><br>In Raleigh, North Carolina, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the state legislative building Tuesday to protest the state's stay-at-home order, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. <br><br>After an hour, police officers asked the group to disperse, saying too many people were there, too close together.

This has caused vision problems in more than half of the astronauts who have spent time on the space station.  <br><br>After returning to Earth, evaluations of the astronauts have revealed swelling of the optic nerve that connects the eye and brain, retinal bleeding, fluffy white patches on the retina and other changes in eye structure.  <br><br>Multiple studies have centered on this phenomenon and how to ease it in astronauts, as well as detect other possible changes in brain caused by spaceflight.  <br><br>\"When you're in microgravity, fluid such as your venous blood no longer pools toward your lower extremities but redistributes headward,\" said Dr. Larry A. Kramer at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and lead study author. \"That movement of fluid toward your head may be one of the mechanisms causing changes we are observing in the eye and intracranial compartment.\" <br><br>Eleven astronauts -- 10 men and one woman -- agreed to participate in the study before and after long-term spaceflight missions on the space station. They underwent brain MRIs before flight, one day after they returned and then several more times over the next year.  <br><br>Five of the astronauts had previous spaceflight experience and six had none, according to the study. The average time spent by the astronauts in space averaged out to 171 days.  <br><br>The researchers noticed that the brain and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in the astronauts expanded and increased by 2%. Cerebrospinal fluid can be found in, and surrounding, the spinal cord, as well as the brain's hollow spaces. These fluids enrich and protect the brain. <br><br>These increases remained one year after spaceflight, which led the researchers to believe that the change was permanent.  <br><br>\"What we identified that no one has really identified before is that there is a significant increase of volume in the brain's white matter from preflight to postflight,\" Kramer said. \"White matter expansion, in fact, is responsible for the largest increase in combined brain and cerebrospinal fluid volumes post-flight.\" <br><br>The pituitary gland in six of the astronauts in the study also showed signs of deformation, likely in response to pressure inside the skull.  <br><br>\"We found that the pituitary gland loses height and is smaller post-flight than it was pre-flight,\" Dr. Kramer said. \"In addition, the dome of the pituitary gland is predominantly convex in astronauts without prior exposure to microgravity but showed evidence of flattening or concavity postflight. This type of deformation is consistent with exposure to elevated intracranial pressures.\" <br><br>Postflight analysis also showed that the astronauts' lateral ventricles had increased in volume. These are areas in the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid. They compared the change to patients who experienced long bouts of bed rest.  <br><br>They also noticed an uptick in the velocity of cerebrospinal fluid flowing through a small channel that connects the four fluid-filled cavities in the center of the brain. It was comparable to patients with hydrocephalus, where those cavities are unusually large. People with hydrocephalus can have dementia, trouble walking or issues with bladder control -- none of which have been associated with astronauts.  <br><br>Previous issues associated with spaceflight, like bone and muscle loss, have been mitigated on the space station with the addition of exercise equipment and the recommendation that astronauts workout for at least two hours a day.  <br><br>Researchers are also trying to find countermeasures to combat the fluid shift and head pressure. One includes a suit on the space station that uses pressure to draw fluid back toward the lower limbs. Another possible idea is a centrifuge that can create artificial gravity.  <br><br>The researchers acknowledged that their study only included a small number of astronauts, among other limiting factors, and that more research is needed.  <br><br>\"If we can better understand the mechanisms that cause ventricles to enlarge in astronauts and develop suitable countermeasures, then maybe some of these discoveries could benefit patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and other related conditions,\" Dr. Kramer said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "131", "title": "School closures may only have a small effect on stopping coronavirus, study says"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

Enormous stars burn large amounts of nuclear energy at their cores, which in turn makes the centers very hot. The heat generates outward pressure that prevents the star from collapsing.  <br><br>However, that pressure has something to fight against as a star's gravity tries to compact it into the smallest, tightest ball possible. When a star runs out of energy, and thus heat, the pressure drops and gravity takes over. The star then collapses, creating shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode.  <br><br>The researchers spotted this super bright supernova in 2016 using data from the Panoramic Survey Telescopes and Rapid Response System. Pan-STARRS is located at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii and consists of telescopes, astronomical cameras and a computing facility that continually survey the sky for objects and offer data on them.  <br><br>The research team measured the newly discovered supernova using two scales: The total energy of the explosion, and the radiation -- or the amount of the explosion's energy that's visible as light, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy. <br><br>The light emitted in ordinary supernovae is usually less than 1% of the total energy. But this supernova, called SN2016aps, radiated more than five times the explosion energy of a typical supernova. After observing the explosion for two years, the scientists found the mass was between 50 to 100 times greater than the sun. The mass of a normal-sized supernova is between eight to 15 times greater.   <br><br>The researchers were searching the night sky trying to pick out the \"most exotic and the most rare types of supernova explosions,\" Edo Berger, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and co-author of the study, said.  <br><br>\"This is one of the best examples we've had,\" he added. \"This is the type of event we estimate is something like one in 1,000 to one in 10,000 stars end their life in this way. So this is an extremely rare type of explosion and incredibly energetic. And this is exactly what we set out to find.\" <br><br>A rare object  <br><br>The astronomers chose to follow up on this supernova because it seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. But as it turns out, the supernova only appeared to be without celestial neighbors because it outshone its own host galaxy.  <br><br>The galaxy in which the explosion was found doesn't have a name yet. But for now, we know the galaxy is about four billion light years away and is very reminiscent of the Magellanic Clouds, two dwarf galaxies that orbit our own galaxy, Berger said.  <br><br>Because of its mass and brightness, the star could be a model of a pulsational pair-instability supernova -- a supernova event that occurs in stars at around 100 to 130 solar mass, the authors wrote in the study. This is incredibly rare for two reasons, Berger said.  <br><br>\"To get to the regime where stars can experience this type of explosion, they need to be born with incredibly high masses. At least 70 times the mass of our sun and maybe up to 250 times the mass of the sun,\" Berger said. \"So stars like that are just incredibly rare. The other ingredient that's required is that the stars need to be born from gas that has low metal content. So it hasn't been enriched by previous generations of a lot of supernova explosions in order to build up these very massive stars. <br><br>\"In the Milky Way Galaxy, which has experienced a lot of supernova explosions over its lifetime, we don't actually see stars like this. So the only way we can study them is by finding them when they explode in other galaxies,\" Berger said. \"That's why these pulsational pair-instability and these pair-instability supernovae are so rare. They need these very special conditions that only allow one in 10,000 stars to achieve that.\"  <br><br>The star's incredible size may be attributable to two smaller (but still huge) stars that merged before the explosion, the study said.  <br><br>When a star explodes, usually a nebula or black hole is left behind. But because SN2016aps is so bright and massive, it's taking years to fade enough to let astronomers see what's behind it.  <br><br>\"These galaxies are collections of 100 billion stars,\" Berger said. \"And yet this one supernova explosion outshone the entire galaxy for more than two years.\"  <br><br>We're just now seeing the supernova, although it technically occurred four billion years ago, because it took this long for its light to reach us.  <br><br>The future of space exploration  <br><br>Discovering events like this explosion is \"starting to get us on a track of understanding what these stars are doing in the last few moments of their lives,\" Berger said.  <br><br>\"This is amazing [that] a star like this probably lives somewhere between five and 10 million years ago, and we're seeing that in the very last, tiny fraction of that entire lifetime this star is becoming incredibly unstable,\" he added. \"That to me is one of the questions that's kind of driving the need to find more of these types of explosions.\"  <br><br>A separate study published Monday in Nature Astronomy found novae -- a star that increases in brightness, then fades to normal over time -- illuminate the sky via the shocks from explosions that create them.  <br><br>Because SN2016aps was so luminous, we're very likely to be able to see other supernovae with next generation technology such as the Large Sypnotic Survey Telescope and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, Berger said.  <br><br>\"Now that we know something like this exists in the universe, it gives us hope that with these next generation facilities, which are only two, three years away from being available, we might be able to see similar explosions like this from the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang.\"  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "57", "title": "The planet that never existed"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

The second interstellar object discovered in our solar system was an interstellar comet, 2I/Borisov, which was observed in 2019.  <br><br>But the dry, rocky reddish, elongated cigar-shaped object had no cometary tail, and its tumbling motion couldn't be explained. And debate has emerged over whether it's an interstellar asteroid or comet.  <br><br>And, of course, there was speculation that 'Oumuamua was a type of alien probe.  <br><br>So Yun Zhang, postdoctoral researcher at the Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur and Douglas Lin, professor emeritus in the department of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used simulations to show how they believe 'Oumuamua formed. <br><br>The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, postulated that 'Oumuamua was once part of a planetary body in another solar system, ripped apart by its host star before being kicked out into space.  <br><br>\"The discovery of 'Oumuamua implies that the population of rocky interstellar objects is much larger than we previously thought,\" Zhang said. \"On average, each planetary system should eject in total about a hundred trillion objects like 'Oumuamua. We need to construct a very common scenario to produce this kind of object.\" <br><br>Using simulations, Zhang and Lin modeled what would happen if a smaller planetary body came too close to its host star. They found that if the planet was close enough to the star, within 186,411 miles, it would be ripped into long pieces. Then, they would be shot out into interstellar space.  <br><br>They also included thermal modeling to determine what would happen to the fragment split off from the planet. Elements like water, would melt on the surface of the object before re-condensing into a strong, stable crust as the object moved further away.  <br><br>\"[This] not only explains 'Oumuamua's surface colors and the absence of visible coma [comet tail], but also elucidates the inferred dryness of the interstellar population,\" Zhang said.  <br><br>Astronomers have wondered what is essentially powering the object forward. 'Oumuamua doesn't have the tail of a comet, but if condensed water existed on the object, it could be releasing and melting, accelerating the object in a comet-like way. This would explain its odd motions.  <br><br>Based on their models, 'Oumuamua could have originated from a half-mile-sized planetesimal, which is a precursor to a planet. Or it could have come from a rocky super-Earth exoplanet (larger than Earth), orbiting a low-mass star or white dwarf, which is the hot core of a star that has exhausted its energy.  <br><br>Learning more about this object could prepare scientists to understand other interstellar objects as they pass through our solar system in the future. And given that they could originate in solar systems with potentially habitable planets, the information these objects carry is of great interest.  <br><br>\"This is a very new field. These interstellar objects could provide critical clues about how planetary systems form and evolve,\" Zhang said. <br><br>\"'Oumuamua is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Lin said. \"We anticipate many more interstellar visitors with similar traits will be discovered by future observation with the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.\"  <br><br>Pioneering American astronomer Vera Rubin once mentored fellow aspiring female astronomers and advocated for women in science.

That suggests that the lizard species is in a rare transitional form between egg-laying and live-bearing animals, according to a study published in Molecular Ecology last month. <br><br>\"We affectionately call the three-toed skink 'the weirdest lizard in the world' -- but it can tell us a lot about the evolution of reproductive strategies,\" Camilla Whittington, one of the study's lead authors and an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, wrote in an email to CNN.  <br><br>It was the first record of egg-laying and live birth in a single pregnancy <br><br>Three-toed skinks, found in Australia, are already a fascinating species for evolutionary scientists, explains Whittington. One reason is that some populations reproduce by laying eggs, while others reproduce through live birth. <br><br>The mode skinks use to reproduce generally corresponds with their environment. Skinks around the Sydney area lay eggs, albeit ones with thin shells and embryos that are almost completely developed. In northern parts of Australia, the skinks give birth to live young. <br><br>But never before had scientists seen a species lay eggs and experience live birth in a single pregnancy until it was observed in the three-toed skink last year, Whittington wrote. It was the first record of a vertebrate doing so.  <br><br>Why this could be happening <br><br>There are a couple of explanations as to why the skink both laid eggs and had a live baby in the same pregnancy, Whittingon said. <br><br>One is that it was a form of \"bet-hedging,\" meaning that the ability to switch between laying eggs and live birth could provide the lizard an advantage in unpredictable environments.   <br><br>\"For example, if it's cold or dry, it might be risky to lay eggs in an unprotected nest, and better for the mums to carry the babies until development is complete,\" she wrote. \"If there are a lot of predators around and pregnant mums find it harder to escape, it might be risky to carry babies to term. Mothers that are able to act flexibly could therefore have an advantage in an unpredictable environment.\" <br><br>Another explanation is that some feature of the environment could have caused the skink in question to lay part of her clutch abnormally early. Still, Whittington said, two of the skink's eggs hatched to healthy baby lizards, which means that if this phenomenon happened in the wild, the babies could still be viable. <br><br>Scientists don't yet know what course evolution is taking <br><br>The finding could mean that the skink is transitioning to only laying eggs or only experiencing live birth. But scientists say it's too soon to tell which direction it's moving in. <br><br>In general, animals that give birth to live young have evolved from ancestors that laid eggs and it would be rare for an animal to evolve in the other direction, according to Whittington. And it's worth pointing out that when this skink does lay eggs, the embyros are almost fully developed and hatch much more quickly than other egg-laying lizards.  <br><br>Still, it's \"impossible\" to determine what course natural selection is taking in this skink species, Whittington said. Their research shows that the uterus of the \"transitional\" three-toed skinks and live-bearing three-toed skinks function similarly, which could make it possible for the species to reverse from live-bearing to egg-laying, she said. <br><br>\"At the moment, we can't rule out the possibility that the transitional animals could be descended from live-bearing ancestors -- which is why we are continuing to study these amazing lizards,\" she wrote. <br><br>\"To complicate things, if the environment changes, the direction of selection could change too! In some environments, natural selection might favour laying eggs. In others, it might be more advantageous to give birth to live young.\" <br><br>And that, Whittington said, is what makes evolution such a fascinating process. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

The new findings ruled out models that were used to guess wind speeds outside of our solar system.  <br><br>\"This new technique opens the way to better understanding the behavior of atmospheres that are unlike anything found in our solar system,\" said Peter Williams, study author and innovation scientist for the Center for Astrophysics collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. <br><br>The measurement was made using a new technique that combined a detection of radio and infrared emissions. This allowed scientists to know the wind speed of a distant object, even though they couldn't pick out cloud movement in its atmosphere. <br><br>\"On Earth, for example, say you have a cloud being blown by some wind,\" said Katelyn Allers, study co-author and physics and astronomy professor at Bucknell University.  <br><br>\"If you're looking down at Earth from space, you could measure the speed of a continent as it rotates in and out of view and a different speed for the cloud as it rotates in and out of view. And that difference in speed occurs because wind has pushed that cloud relative to the surface,\" Allers said. <br><br>Distant brown dwarfs and exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system, are a little more complicated. <br><br>\"We can't see the clouds themselves, but when a cloud rotates into view or out of view, it changes the brightness of the planet,\" she said.  <br><br>\"Even though brown dwarfs are completely covered in clouds, they're too far away for us to pick out individual clouds like we do on planets within our solar system. But we can still measure how long it takes for a group of clouds to do a lap around the atmosphere; as clouds come in and out of view they change the brightness of the planet,\" Williams said.  <br><br>\"This lap time depends on two things: how fast the brown dwarf itself is spinning, and how fast the wind is blowing on top of that.\" <br><br>Data from NASA's recently retired Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as from the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array of telescopes in New Mexico, was crucial for the measurement. The scientists were able to monitor the brightness of the brown dwarf and track its changes.  <br><br>Because the brown dwarf is cold, it emits infrared light. Spitzer, an infrared telescope, was designed to pick up its signal. The Jansky array allowed them to use radiowaves to determine the rotation beneath the atmosphere by detecting the planet's magnetic field. <br><br>\"Since the magnetic field originates deep in the planet, or in this case brown dwarf, the radio data allows us to determine the interior period of rotation,\" Allers said. \"When you have an interior rotation rate and an atmospheric rotation rate, you can compare them to see how fast the wind is blowing.\" <br><br>Similar to Jupiter, this brown dwarf's atmosphere is rotating faster than its interior. But Jupiter's wind speeds max out at 230 miles per hour -- slow and steady compared to the screaming winds of the brown dwarf.  <br><br>But the 1,450 miles per hour clocked speed agrees with previous predictions by astronomers that brown dwarfs would have high winds.  <br><br>This new technique developed during the study could be used to measure wind speeds on other brown dwarfs and exoplanets as well, the researchers said.  <br><br>\"We're excited that our method can now be used to help us better understand the atmospheric dynamics of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets,\" Allers said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "123", "title": "Scientists uncover a 60,000-year-old forest underwater and think its preserved trees may help pioneer new medicines"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

The study published Thursday in the journal Science. <br><br>\"This is presumably why most of these overwater dispersal events that we know of in the fossil record involve very small animals,\" Seiffert said. <br><br>Only two other species of \"immigrant\" mammals are thought to have made what would have been a harsh crossing across the Atlantic, although exactly how they got there has long been a topic of heated discussion. <br><br>One was New World Monkeys, or platyrrhine primates, which are five families of flat-nosed primates that are found in south and central America today. The other was a type of rodent known as caviomorphs, ancestors of creatures like the capybara.  <br><br>Teeth like 'fingerprint for paleontologists' <br><br>The team of researchers found the molars during an excavation of the left bank of the Yuru\u00e1 River in the Peruvian Amazon. The animal has been named Ucayalipithecus perdita, which comes from Ucayali, the area of the Peruvian Amazon where the teeth were found, pithikos, the Greek word for monkey and perdita, the Latin word for lost.   <br><br>It would have weighed about 12 ounces (350 grams) and was similar in size to some marmosets that live in South America today.  <br><br>Seiffert said that the fossilized molars strongly resembled those of a now-extinct family of African primates called Parapithecidae, who lived in what is now Egypt, Libya, and Tanzania some 23 million to 56 million years ago.  <br><br>\"If Ucayalipithecus was like its African parapithecid relatives, it would have lived in the trees and probably would have been an agile leaper,\" Seiffert said.   <br><br>Mammals teeth, and particularly the molar teeth, are extremely diverse in shape, and the unique arrangements of bumps and crests on teeth are almost like fingerprints for paleontologists, Seiffert explained.  <br><br>\"The teeth of Ucayalipithecus allow us to place this monkey in the primate family tree, but also tell us something about what it ate - in this case, it would appear that Ucayalipithecus probably ate primarily fruit.\" <br><br>Improbable find <br><br>Seiffert said that he had been skeptical that animals could have \"rafted\" across an ocean but he said a video of pieces of land floating down the Panama Canal after a storm had helped convince him.

The study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. <br><br>The six-millimetre-long cord fragment, consisting of three bundles of fibers twisted together and wrapped around a thin stone tool, was discovered at the prehistoric cave site of Abri du Maras in the south of France. <br><br>The yarn dates from 41,000 to 52,000 years ago and researchers said the cord is made from fibers taken from the inner bark of a tree, likely a conifer. The authors believe that the cord was wrapped around the tool as a handle or was part of a net or bag containing the tool. <br><br>\"It's impossible that nature made this twisted fiber,\" said study author Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Moncel, who is a director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) <br><br>The research suggests that production of the cord would have required extensive knowledge of the growth and seasonality of the trees used.  <br><br>\"In order to get this fiber, you have to strip the outer bark off a tree to scrape off the inner bark.

But British scientists are skeptical", "content": " (CNN)British scientists have pushed back against an influential new coronavirus model that predicts the UK will be the worst-hit European country, with a death toll from Covid-19 possibly much higher than previously thought.   <br><br>The grim forecast came from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine in Seattle on Tuesday. It predicted 66,314 people would die of Covid-19 in the UK by early August.  <br><br>The British government's plan for tackling the epidemic has been largely informed by a study from the Imperial College London, which said that a lockdown and social distancing measures would -- hopefully -- limit the number of deaths to between 20,000 and 30,000. <br><br>But several high-profile scientists in the UK have already voiced their concerns over the IHME model.  <br><br>Professor Sylvia Richardson, of Cambridge University and the co-chair of the Royal Statistical Society Task Force on Covid-19, told the Science Media Centre the projections are based on \"very strong assumptions about the way the epidemic will progress.\" <br><br>She said the model was \"based mostly on using the experience in other countries to fit a smooth curve to the counts of deaths reported so far in the UK, rather than any modeling of the epidemic itself.\"  <br><br>\"Methods like this are well known for being extremely sensitive, and are likely to change dramatically as new information comes in,\" Richardson added. <br><br>Racing against the clock <br><br>Like most other countries, the UK has been racing to increase its healthcare capacity ahead of the predicted peak of the epidemic. A new field hospital in east London with a capacity of up to 5,000 beds, the NHS Nightingale, accepted its first patients on Wednesday.  <br><br>However, the IHME model suggests this might not be enough. It said the shortage of intensive care (ICU) beds would peak at 23,745 on April 17. <br><br>The IHME said the peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds, which compares to the  17,765 currently available. It added that 24,544 ICU beds will be needed, compared to the 799 beds it estimates will be available. <br><br>Professor David Spiegelhalter, who chairs the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at University of Cambridge, told the Science Media Centre he was \"very skeptical\" of the projections.  <br><br>\"[They] are based on assuming a rather simple mathematical model for the whole course of the epidemic,\" he said. \"I suspect they will change a lot as new data arrives -- we shall see.\" <br><br>Epidemiological modeling is a tricky discipline, because it relies in part on assumptions. The models often need updating as more data comes in. <br><br>\"The outputs of any model should not really be treated as a prediction of what is going to happen,\" said Dr. Simon Gubbins, head of the Transmission Biology Group at The Pirbright Institute in England. \"Rather they represent plausible scenarios, based on knowledge at the time they were generated and assumptions made in the model ... that can be used to help inform decisions of policy makers,\" he told the Science Media Centre. <br><br>The authors of the IHME forecast admit their model is highly uncertain, giving the range of possible deaths in the UK as between 55,022 and 79,995.  <br><br>This was the first time the IHME team published models for several European countries, including the UK. On Wednesday, the institute updated its US forecast, predicting 60,415 deaths in the country, significantly fewer than the 82,000 it predicted on Tuesday. <br><br>The researchers based their findings on models of the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan, the Chinese city which was the original epicenter of the outbreak, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including the Spanish capital of Madrid and the Lombardy region in Italy. <br><br>They also factored in data from local and national governments, the World Health Organization and information on each country's social distancing policies. <br><br>CNN's Vasco Cotovio in London contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

The Permian mass extinction event, as it's known, wiped out 95% of marine life and 70% of species on land. Unlike the asteroid that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the cause of the Permian extinction isn't directly known -- although researchers believe volcanic eruptions and a warming climate played a role.  <br><br>An evolution of animal life happened in the years after the Permian mass extinction event, but some groups flourished more than others. A category of reptiles called archosaurs were among them.  <br><br>Archosaurs included large predatory reptiles; plant-eating ones; armored, crocodile-like reptiles; and primitive dinosaurs. They thrived and spread out across the globe during the Triassic Period.  <br><br>A mysterious group from this time period called tanystropheids has long captivated researchers. Various specimens of these long-necked reptiles have appeared over the years, usually from the Middle to Late Triassic period in areas across Asia, Europe and North America. <br><br>The bizarre reptiles had necks so long, they included anywhere between eight and thirteen elongated vertebrae.

So it came as a welcome surprise when researchers discovered the Early Triassic fossil of a similar-looking reptile in southern Brazil's Sanga do Cabral Formation. <br><br>They believe it's a cousin, and the closest known relative, of the tanystropheid. The study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.  <br><br>The researchers named the new species Elessaurus gondwanoccidens. Fans of J. R. R.

In Quenya, Elessar means \"elf-stone.\" And Elessar Telcontar is the name chosen by King Aragorn II -- who also goes by the nicknames Strider and Longshanks. <br><br>Given the fact that this reptile had long legs, the researchers felt it was appropriate, they said. <br><br>The species name, gondwanoccidens, is derived from the supercontinent Gondwana that once included the modern-day regions of Antarctica, South America, Africa, India, the Arabian Peninsula, Australia and New Zealand. And in Latin, \"occidens\" means \"from west.\" Together, the species name suggests the location of the fossil.  <br><br>An analysis of the long-legged Elessaurus revealed that it likely lived on land, the researchers said. The fact that this tanystropheid cousin lived on land, and further south from its mysterious relative, suggests that Elessaurus diversified, spread and evolved after the Permian extinction. <br><br>The researchers now believe that Elessaurus may be the ancestor of later tanystropheids, which evolved to live in the water of northern continents.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "164", "title": "Meteorites reveal that Martian water came from different sources"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

As the trees grew old, they fell and were buried under sediment. When the sea level rose, the remains of the forest were covered once again. <br><br>Now, scientists have uncovered that same forest and believe it may hold the secrets to creating new medicines and saving lives.  <br><br>For millennia, the ancient forest remained undisturbed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which published an article about the forest last week.  <br><br>But in 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Gulf Coast, sweeping up the seabed and sediment that kept the forest entombed.  <br><br>Since then, the site, which now lies 60 feet underwater off Alabama's coast in Mobile Bay has been visited by a few scientists and filmmakers. But it wasn't until December that a team of scientists from Northeastern University and the University of Utah set out on an expedition funded by NOAA to dive into the waters and bring back pieces of wood to study.  <br><br>Brian Helmuth, a professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University, was one of the scientists who dived in.  <br><br>\"It was a really nice day. Pretty calm on the surface and we were expecting it be equally nice on the bottom,\" Helmuth told CNN. \"But we got to the bottom and it was like diving in chocolate milk. We literally could not see our hands in front of our faces.\"  <br><br>The conditions were less than ideal and the fact that previous dive teams saw a lot of sharks in the area made the expedition somewhat risky, but when the scientists finally reached the forest, they were in awe.  <br><br>\"It was really amazing. We dove around the edge of this ancient river bed. On our left were these remains of giant stumps and pristine wood coming out of the bank embankment,\" Helmuth recalled. \"Even though the visibility wasn't great, you could pretty easily imagine it being the edge of a cypress forest and it was almost an eerie feeling of stepping back in time.\"   <br><br>Despite the wood being 60,000 years old, it was extremely well-preserved because it had been buried under layers of sediment that prevented oxygen from decomposing it.  <br><br>\"It really looked like something that you could have picked up from today. It still had bark on it. It still had all the coloration on the inside. It was just locked away for 60,000 years,\" Helmuth said.   <br><br>But the real excitement for the scientists started when they took the wood back to the lab.  <br><br>\"We were able to take a look at what kind of organisms had taken advantage of this exposed, ancient wood. The different kind of animals buried in there and what kind of animals are living on top of it as well,\" Francis Choi, a senior lab manager at Northeastern University's Marine Science Center, said.  <br><br>Out of the more than 300 animals that were removed from the wood, scientists were particularly focused on just one: shipworms, a type of clam that converts wood into animal tissue, according to NOAA.  <br><br>Shipworms aren't new to science. They're common and can be found in most oceans wherever there's wood. But the bacteria found from the shipworms that had been living inside the 60,000-year-old wood had never been discovered before.  <br><br>\"We were able to isolate bacteria from them and get some bacteria that we haven't worked with before, so we're really excited about that,\" Margo Haygood, a research professor of medicinal chemistry at University of Utah, told CNN.  <br><br>The shipworms from the ancient wood produced 100 strains of bacteria, many of them novel, and 12 are undergoing DNA sequencing to evaluate their potential to make new drug treatments. <br><br>Previous research on shipworm bacteria has already resulted in at least one antibiotic being studied as a drug to treat parasitic infections, according to NOAA. So scientists, including Haygood, are feeling optimistic about these new strains of shipworm bacteria.  <br><br>\"We screened for antimicrobials and for neurological activity, which is in the direction of pain drugs as well as anti-cancer drugs,\" Haygood said. \"We have not been (working on antivirals) in the past, but right now my department at University of Utah is spinning up to start including viral assays in the program.\"  <br><br>In addition to lifesaving medicines, scientists will study the new samples to see whether they can be applied in production of paper, textiles, food, animal feeds, fine chemicals and renewable fuels, according to NOAA.  <br><br>While the coronavirus pandemic has put any future dives to the ancient forest on hold, Haygood said she and the team of scientists will continue to study the samples and hope to publish the results within a year.  <br><br>Choi said they're also working on getting AUVs, which are unmanned underwater robots, to capture images and make 3D visualizations to share the wonder of this 60,000-year-old forest with the rest of the world.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

Elias shared a few links with open source files to 3D print face shields.  <br><br>\"I think early on in this crisis we wanted to be prepared,\" Elias told CNN. \"And what we were realizing is with the rate of patients that were coming to the hospitals and the supplies that we had, we were really concerned about if supply could meet demand.\" <br><br>Elias said 3D printing is helpful in the short term because \"it allows for rapid prototyping, and you're not dependent on supply chains.\"  <br><br>The librarian started to work right away. She spent all night researching various models, and got permission from her bosses to bring two 3D printers from the library back to her apartment, since the campus had already closed and she was working remotely.  <br><br>Choksi made a few changes to an open source face shield model from 3D printing company Budmen Industries, including making the file about 8% smaller to reduce the printing time of the visor, which is the only 3D-printed component of the face shield, to around an hour. An elastic band, foam band, and sheet of transparent plastic complete the face shield.  <br><br>Two days after the initial help request, Choksi presented Elias with five reusable face shields. The next day Elias asked her if she could do about a thousand of them.  <br><br>Elias said Choksi \"really took up\" the call to help health care workers.  <br><br>\"The amount of care that she has for health workers in New York City is immense. She just has a deep passion for trying to help,\" Elias added.  <br><br>Volunteering while social distancing  <br><br>Choksi said she used social media to spread the word about her effort, and soon after, she landed the help of two 3D printing companies, MakerBot and Tangible Creative, to print the visors. The partnership  also includes Columbia Libraries,  which is helping with the rest of the materials. Her library colleagues and volunteers started to assemble the face shields.  <br><br>The group was in Choksi's apartment up until March 25. \"I was receiving about 150 and 200 of [visors] a day and trying to put them together at home. And I realized, you know, this isn't sustainable.\"  <br><br>Through a friend, Choksi found a space at 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, and very quickly an assembly line was formed -- it takes only a couple minutes to assemble the face shield -- that has helped them make over 7,500 face shields since they started at Choksi's apartment. The shields have all been donated to hospitals.  <br><br>\"I feel a responsibility to do all that I can as someone who is a technologist,\" Choksi said. \"We have to do all we can for the true heroes on the front lines, our medical professionals.\"  <br><br>Columbia librarians created the website Covid Maker Response, where hospitals can request face shields. <br><br>Why face shields are important <br><br>The reusable face shield is meant for health care workers to use as an extra layer of protection over N95 masks. It covers the forehead and eyes, going ear to ear and all the way down to the bottom of the neck.  <br><br>Elias said a face shield is especially helpful when a patient is producing aerosolizing particles.  <br><br>\"If you were intubating a patient, if you're doing chest compressions on the patient, or if you know, the patient was breathing very hard or very difficult for a reason that all of that is producing droplets into the air ... that's very, very high risk,\" Elias said.  <br><br>Elias has distributed around 1,400 face shields among his colleagues, and said the best part of this effort \"is seeing people's faces light up.\"  <br><br>\"I came with a box full of them,\" Elias recalled of one of the times he was distributing the face shields. \"I was talking with a nurse who I've known for years and I asked her how's morale and she said 'better now' when she looked at the box ... that made me feel pretty good.\"  <br><br>3D printing on the front lines <br><br>Across the US, people have taken the do-it-yourself approach to help with the PPE shortage. From printing businesses to schools  to doctors, all have responded to the urgent call from hospitals and care centers that there is not enough protective gear for health care workers to remain safe while taking care of patients in the Covid-19 pandemic.  <br><br>Engineering and technology experts at Duke University used the school's 3D-printing lab to test over 100 face shield prototypes. With the help of students and medical professionals who tested them, the team chose a 3D-printed headband to produce a reusable face shield when attached to a laser-cut piece of plastic with high-impact resistance.  <br><br>The Duke team has been working on producing 1,000 3D-printed headbands with the school's 65 printers and the face shields will go to health care workers at Duke and UNC hospitals.  <br><br>The National Institutes of Health created a website to help keep track of 3D-printing technologies to produce PPE. The Budmen Industries model that Choksi optimized is now recommended for use after it was reviewed in a clinical trial \"when fabricated as instructed,\" according to the NIH website.   <br><br>Choksi said she and the rest of her librarian colleagues and other volunteers know that what they're doing is not a long-term solution to the PPE supply problem, but she hopes that medically approved PPE can be produced soon at the scale needed to meet the demand. <br><br>\"But until that happens, we're moving full speed ahead.\" Choksi said.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

In the US, cases of Covid-19 in children made up less than 2% of the 149,760 laboratory-confirmed cases occurring in the country between February 12 and April 2. <br><br>But while their symptoms may be mild compared to those experienced by adults with the virus, children can still spread Covid-19 to more vulnerable people, which is why many governments took the decision to shut schools.  <br><br>According to UNESCO, nationwide school closures are currently impacting over 91% of the world's student population -- roughly 1.6 billion children and young adults. The UN agency said that 188 countries have implemented nationwide closures. <br><br>This isn't something policymakers decided on a whim. Past experiences have shown that shutting schools early in a seasonal flu epidemic can help slow down the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people who get sick. But the UCL study suggests that while this may be true for the flu -- which tends to be spread by children -- it doesn't necessary hold true for outbreaks of other diseases.  <br><br>The scientists suggest that policymakers should consider other \"less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools,\" especially if the pandemic-related restrictions need to be in place for a long time.  <br><br>Keeping schools open for the children of key workers, or staggering school start and finish times, may be a way forward. Close monitoring of students' health, for example through temperature checks, and sending kids with symptoms home, could be another solution.  <br><br>But some experts have warned against jumping to conclusions based on one study.  <br><br>Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London and the author of the epidemiological study that has informed the British government's plan to tackle the epidemic, told the Science Media Centre that the UCL researchers had failed to consider the impact of school closures in combination with other lockdown measures.  <br><br>\"While school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 transmission, when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households, and thus ensuring transmission declines,\" he said.  <br><br>When considering whether or not to shut schools, policymakers must balance the need to protect public health with the huge disruptive effects such closures can cause. <br><br>Scientists are increasingly warning of the potential impact of long-term school closures on the mental health and wellbeing of children, warning that more research is needed.  <br><br>\"The longer schools, colleges and universities are closed, we do risk the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people who are vulnerable because of the situation created by self-isolation and social distancing policies,\" Catherine Carroll-Meehan, from the School of Education and Sociology at the University of Portsmouth, told the Science Media Centre. <br><br>With children forced to stay at home, a large proportion of working parents are likely to miss work.  <br><br>Previous studies in the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that as many as 30% of healthcare workers have children they would need to take care of if schools were closed. A separate study published in The Lancet last week estimated that one in seven frontline medical workers in the US may miss work to care for their children when US schools are closed. <br><br>Another common solution -- leaving children with their grandparents -- is particularly risky in the case of Covid-19, as the elderly are among those most vulnerable to the virus. <br><br>The economic costs of shutting schools can snowball quickly. Studies in the US have showed that as much as 3% of America's GDP could be lost as a result of an eight-week closure of US schools.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color.  <br><br>Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately. But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life. <br><br>Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching. <br><br>What he saw was unprecedented.  <br><br>\"For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,\" he said.  <br><br>Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching. <br><br>The bleaching event this year is not only the largest, in terms of the area affected, but also second most severe on record, the scientists found, with the damage likely to be lasting and irreparable.  <br><br>In 2016, bleaching killed more than half of the shallow-water corals on the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef. A second mass bleaching in 2017 meant the coral could not recover.  <br><br>This year, the cumulative footprint of bleaching has expanded further south, affecting more fragile and heat-sensitive corals.  <br><br>Hughes said they won't know the full extend of the loss of corals until they go back to the same reefs conduct underwater surveys in October or November.  <br><br>Bleaching events getting more frequent <br><br>Coral reefs are some of the most vibrant marine ecosystems on the planet -- between a quarter and one-third of all marine species rely on them at some point in their life cycle. <br><br>And none is more vital than the Great Barrier Reef. <br><br>Covering nearly 133,000 square miles, it is the world's largest coral reef and is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species. <br><br>It's also a vital resource to Australia's economy, contributing more than $5.6 billion annually and supporting tens of thousands of jobs. <br><br>As bleaching expands and becomes more frequent, corals are at greater risk of dying off -- and that will be devastating not only for the region's biodiversity, but for the thousands of people whose life and livelihood depend on the reefs.  <br><br>The scientists' main concern this year is the southern region, which escaped the bleaching during 2016 and 2017 as water temperatures were close to normal, Hughes said.  <br><br>Because it has not been bleached before, this portion of the reef has more coral that is sensitive to the heat. Most susceptible to dying off are ecologically important species such as the staghorn, or branching, corals that are ideal habitats for an array of species of fish and other marine life.  <br><br>\"When we go back underwater in a few months time, we anticipate significant mortality or loss of those corals,\" Hughes said. <br><br>He anticipates that as much as half of these \"red reefs\" that suffered the most severe bleaching this year to have died because that's what happened in the northern reefs in 2016. <br><br>Another concern is the shrinking gap between one mass bleaching and the next. The first recorded bleaching event along the Great Barrier Reef occurred in 1998 -- then the hottest year on record.  <br><br>Four more severe bleaching events have occurred since, in 2002, 2016, 2017, and now in 2020.  <br><br>This year, February saw the highest monthly sea temperatures ever recorded on the reef since records from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began in 1900. Many reefs experienced temperatures that were 3\u00b0C above the normal summer maximum. <br><br>\"That's incredibly destructive. Those extreme temperatures can kill the coral very quickly,\" Hughes said. \"We really are on uncharted territory here in terms of rising temperatures.\" <br><br>Fewer opportunities for recovery <br><br>Past bleaching events have typically occurred in years with a strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a climate phenomena that can increase the odds of a host of extreme weather events around the globe.  <br><br>But as summers get hotter year on year in Australia, scientists found that bleaching can occur even when El Nino is not active.  <br><br>That could have a huge impact on whether the reefs can recover.  <br><br>Hughes said it takes about a decade for the fastest growing corals to make a full recovery. As bleaching events become more frequent, there are fewer opportunities for the corals to rebound.  <br><br>\"Normal recovery rates for the reef are being impinged by the scale of the loss of the adult root stock -- that's the grown up corals that make the babies,\" Hughes said.  <br><br>Reefs are important because they protect shorelines and coastal regions from erosion and extreme weather events. They are also source of food security for millions of people around the world. <br><br>According to a study by the United Nations on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, coral reefs benefit about 850 million people worldwide, with at least 275 million depending directly on reefs for livelihoods and sustenance. <br><br>Already in Australia, fish stocks on the Great Barrier Reef are declining because of loss of habitat, Hughes said.  <br><br>You take out the coral, the ecosystem collapses and marine life dies.  <br><br>The mass bleaching conditions were also observed in late March by Coral Reef Watch, which uses remote sensing and modeling to predict and monitor for signs of bleaching. <br><br>Dr. C. Mark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch, told CNN last month that because of the massive amounts of heat the world's oceans have already absorbed, the reef likely won't have the chance to recover before it bleaches again. <br><br>\"If it takes decades for a reef to recover ... what chance do we have for reefs recovering when events are coming back this fast?\" he said. <br><br>Though researchers around the world are exploring ways to revive reefs, Eakin says those efforts will not be enough if we don't address the root cause of their demise -- human-caused climate change. <br><br>\"We have to address climate change if we want to have coral reefs in the future.\" <br><br>CNN's Andrew Kann contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "114", "title": "New US model predicts much higher Covid-19 death toll in UK.

The decision casts more uncertainty on when Starliner can be used to begin carrying NASA astronauts into orbit \u2014 a milestone that's already years overdue. <br><br>The company said in a statement Monday that it will repeat the uncrewed test flight so that it can complete \"all flight test objectives\" and fully evaluate Starliner's design. The news was first reported by the Washington Post. <br><br>The do-over flight will likely happen this fall, according to a person familiar with the matter. Even if the test flight goes off without a hitch, it's not clear how soon after that Boeing would be able to get a crewed mission off the ground. But Boeing (BA) could conceivably have two Starliner spacecraft \u2014 one for the test flight and another for the first crewed mission \u2014 ready for both missions by the end of the year, the person said. <br><br>Boeing and NASA declined to comment on the matter beyond the statements they issued Monday. <br><br>Boeing launched Starliner into space for the first time in December, and problems arose almost immediately. A software issue caused the spacecraft to misfire. One of the primary goals of the mission, to prove Starliner can safely dock with the International Space Station, had to be abandoned. And the craft was forced to return from space days earlier than expected.  <br><br>NASA and Boeing officials revealed several other major software and communications issues in the weeks after the botched December test flight.  <br><br>Boeing had said in an earnings release in January that the company set aside $410 million to pay for a second uncrewed test flight. But until Monday, it was not clear if the aerospace giant would need to repeat the uncrewed test or if it would move forward with a crewed mission. <br><br>NASA and Boeing officials had not ruled out the latter option when asked by reporters at several press briefings over the past few months.  <br><br>But NASA said in a statement Monday that Boeing had \"decided\" it would conduct a full redo of the December mission, and the space agency agreed to that proposal. NASA added that it \"will not speculate\" on whether it would have required the mission to be repeated if Boeing hadn't made that decision. <br><br>Boeing said in its statement Monday that the test flight will come \"at no cost to the taxpayer.\"  <br><br>NASA announced earlier this month that it would launch a full-scale safety review of Boeing's work on Starliner, noting that there were \"numerous instances where the Boeing software quality processes either should have or could have uncovered the defects.\" <br><br>A separate review carried about by a team of NASA and Boeing experts sought to determine what went wrong during the first uncrewed test flight. It found that Boeing would need to carry out a thorough review of Starliner's software, among other things. <br><br>NASA said in its statement that a \"second uncrewed flight does not relieve Boeing from completing\" those reviews. <br><br>The company has worked for the past decade to prepare Starliner for crewed missions, ever since NASA retired its space shuttle program and asked the private sector to design spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. <br><br>The space agency allocated $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX in 2014 for that task. NASA initially hoped Boeing's and SpaceX's new vehicles would be up and running by 2017. Meanwhile, the space agency has\u00a0paid\u00a0Russia to fly American astronauts to the space station aboard Soyuz spacecraft. <br><br>SpaceX, which developed a spacecraft called Crew Dragon, is also behind schedule. But the company already completed an uncrewed demo flight last year, and it is currently preparing to launch its first crewed mission this spring.  <br><br>It's not yet clear if the COVID-19 pandemic might affect that schedule.

Some don't even have gowns,\" he said. \"You can put me in the exact same ER and I would witness the exact same evolution of chaos.\" <br><br>New York City is now the epicenter of the US coronavirus outbreak. Central Park and the city's harbor have become makeshift hospitals, and nearly 1,200 employees of the police force have tested positive. City officials applied to the federal government for a second disaster relief morgue, one official said.  <br><br>Statewide, 75,795 people had tested positive for Covid-19 through Wednesday morning, accounting for more than 40% of all US cases. <br><br>Health care workers on the front lines, including thousands of New York's nurses, are especially vulnerable to infection. <br><br>\"In my particular emergency department, we have an area cordoned off for the Covid-positive patients and the presumptive positive patients, but because of a lack of space, they're all housed together, which is a big problem for infection control,\" said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, president of the New York State Nurses Association. <br><br>Sun has been using social media to alert the public about the danger medical professionals face at New York City's hospitals. Throughout the crisis, he's been updating his Instagram story daily with dispatches from the trenches of this pandemic. <br><br>\"I can speak on behalf of all my fellow colleagues in this fight that you're never really sure what's going to happen in the future, especially when it takes about five to eight days for you to catch it and develop symptoms,\" he said. \"And we can't really test unless you have symptoms, given the lack of testing kits and (PPE) provided for us by the higher-ups.\" <br><br>For weeks now, doctors across the nation have been emphasizing the importance of increased testing to understand the true scope of the spread of coronavirus. But Sun warns that showing up to the emergency room  simply for a coronavirus test could be a potentially deadly move.  <br><br>\"Testing is so necessary to contain this spread. We need to screen everyone, but also, it's not about what you do but how you do it,\" Sun said. \"Because let's say you didn't have Covid-19. And then you come to the emergency room to get a test, and then we test you. It's gonna be negative, right.  <br><br>\"And then, a person sitting next to you coughs in your face because you're in the emergency room. And then two to three days later, you get a phone call on that test you got two or three days ago. It's negative. Then, you hug grandma, and then grandma gets Covid-19. And then two to three weeks later, I'm putting her on life support. That's on you, right? It doesn't make sense to come to an emergency room because of the risk of cross-contamination.\" <br><br>Only those who cannot speak a full sentence without losing their breath should head to the ER, Sun said. Otherwise, monitor symptoms from home. <br><br>After finishing a 10-hour shift at 2 a.m. on March 27, an exhausted Sun caught a ride-share home and reflected upon another intense night. <br><br>\"Today was just a sign that things are getting worse and worse. I had about three deaths in the span of the first six hours, he said. \"One was truly sad. (He) waited a few days for a bed, and it was too full upstairs so he stayed in the ER, and from Covid-19, he just lost his pulses. We worked on him for an hour, and then he died.\" <br><br>Despite the tremendous obstacles ahead, Sun is committed to the oath he took as a physician to care for the sick. <br><br>\"This is still New York, and the lights are still on,\" he said as he looked out the window on the ride home. \"That's a sign that things are going to keep on going, if we keep on fighting.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

They were able to confirm the observation of an intermediate-mass black hole, known as an IMBH, inside a dense cluster of stars. <br><br>The study published this week in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.  <br><br>Only a few other possible mid-range black holes have been found before. They're difficult to detect because they're smaller than the supermassive black holes that can be found at the heart of large galaxies. At the same time, they're larger than black holes that form when stars collapse and die.  <br><br>The nature of these mid-range black holes makes them harder to spot because they aren't as active as supermassive black holes. They are also lacking the telltale gravitational pull on objects around them, which can create a detectable X-ray glow. <br><br>This particular black hole is more than 50,000 times the mass of our sun.  <br><br>\"Intermediate-mass black holes are very elusive objects, and so it is critical to carefully consider and rule out alternative explanations for each candidate. That is what Hubble has allowed us to do for our candidate,\" said Dacheng Lin, principal investigator of the study and research assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire. <br><br>Hubble was used to follow up on observations previously made by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's X-Ray Multi-Mirror Mission. Both were launched in 1999 and have been providing X-ray observations of space ever since.  <br><br>They first detected X-ray flares in 2006 that might signify a black hole, but astronomers couldn't tell based on data if the signal was within our galaxy or outside of it.  <br><br>The signal source was named 3XMM J215022.4\u2212055108. After ruling out its location in our galaxy or the possibility that it was a neutron star -- the condensed remains of a dead star -- the astronomers turned to Hubble. <br><br>Aiming Hubble toward what they believed to be the source of the X-rays, the space telescope's images revealed the signal was coming from a distant cluster of stars on the edge of another galaxy.  <br><br>This excited the astronomers because it might be the perfect spot for an intermediate-mass black hole.  <br><br>To confirm their finding, the astronomers looked back through X-ray data gathered by the X-ray Multi Mirror Mission. In the archives, they found evidence of an X-ray glow from a shredded star -- something this black hole likely tore into and ate. This allowed them to estimate its mass and determine it was mid-range. <br><br>\"Adding further X-ray observations allowed us to understand the total energy output,\" said Natalie Webb, study co-author and astrophysicist at the Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse in France. \"This helps us to understand the type of star that was disrupted by the black hole.\" <br><br>The star cluster that serves as the home of this black hole is likely what's left of a small dwarf galaxy that was disturbed by a larger galaxy it orbits.  <br><br>Now that they have confirmed an intermediate-mass black hole, astronomers are on the lookout for the signs of the next one, like a star disrupted by passing too close to the black hole.  <br><br>More research can help them determine if supermassive black holes evolve and grow from intermediate-mass black holes, if they tend to favor star clusters and how they grow in the first place.  <br><br>\"Studying the origin and evolution of the intermediate mass black holes will finally give an answer as to how the supermassive black holes that we find in the centers of massive galaxies came to exist,\" Webb said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "76", "title": "Astronomers saw a star dancing around a black hole.

In the US, more than 40 spring breakers have tested positive for the virus after taking a flight from Austin, Texas, to Mexico in defiance of public health advice. In Uganda, members of a world-renowned children's choir have fallen ill after returning from the UK two weeks ago. Some countries have taken drastic measures to curb the social spread of the disease. Panama has resorted to separating genders, allowing women and men\u00a0to run errands in public on alternating days. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has warned that people who are \"unruly\" or who break quarantine may be shot by police. In South Asia, experts worry coronavirus protection measures may provide an opportunity for organized crime to surge in the region. More than\u00a0939,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported worldwide, and\u00a0over 47,000 people have died. Follow updates here.\u00a0 <br><br>\u00a0 <br><br>2. Health\u00a0 <br><br>Not enough equipment, not enough tests: That's the reality facing American health care workers. The Trump administration says it will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas while there is such a critical shortage at home. Officials at the Strategic National Stockpile\u00a0have shipped out the last rounds of its inventory, depleting the bulk of protective gear long before need across the country is met.\u00a0The White House coronavirus task force\u00a0may also soon recommend the public wear masks, since it appears countries in Asia where the practice is common are seeing lower infection rates and faster containment. As for tests,\u00a0one of the nation's largest commercial labs faces\u00a0a backlog of about\u00a0160,000 coronavirus tests, delaying results by up to 10 days.\u00a0 <br><br>3. Guns <br><br>It's not just toilet paper people are rushing to buy. The FBI reported 3.7 million gun purchase background checks in the month of March, a 41% surge that indicates more and more people are trying to buy guns. Updated guidance from the federal government has designated firearm and ammunition retailers as essential services, which means they can stay open despite a growing number of states issuing stay-at-home orders. The decision is a victory for Second Amendment rights groups, some of which had already filed lawsuits in places where gun retailers weren't exempted in stay-at-home orders.  <br><br>\u00a0 <br><br>4. NASA <br><br>For the first time since the final space shuttle mission in 2011, NASA says astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket and spacecraft from American soil. The agency is partnering with SpaceX for a manned SpaceX Demo-2 flight test in May from Kennedy Space Center. Of course, this launch date could be postponed depending on the state of the coronavirus crisis. This is a big step for\u00a0NASA's Commercial Crew Program. By facilitating commercial spaceflights, the agency says it's providing another way for astronauts to get to and from the International Space Station. And it looks like a lot of people are interested in blasting off: More than 12,000 people applied to be part of NASA's next class of astronauts.\u00a0 <br><br>5. Daniel Pearl <br><br>A local court in Pakistan has overturned the death sentence and murder convictions of four men believed to be involved in the 2002 killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl.\u00a0All had been in prison for 18 years. Three were handed life sentences, and a fourth,\u00a0Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, was awaiting execution.\u00a0The high court in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh vacated Sheikh's murder conviction and reduced his sentence to a shorter prison term for kidnapping. Pearl was\u00a0working as the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped by militants in Pakistan and later murdered.

Underwater volcanoes release lava at 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit that solidifies into basaltic rock as the hot rock reacts to the cold ocean depths.  <br><br>Hydrothermal vents along the ocean floor have been known to sustain bacteria and other life that convert minerals into energy, rather than light.  <br><br>Previously, researchers have studied bacteria systems that were between 3.5 and 8 million years old. But 90% of the ocean floor is much older than that.  <br><br>Yohey Suzuki, an associate professor in the University of Tokyo's Department of Earth and Planetary Science, and his colleagues investigated samples of basaltic lava found 328 feet below the ocean floor between Tahiti and New Zealand that ranged from 33 to 104 million years old.  <br><br>There, they found a wealth of single-celled microbial life living in tiny cracks among the rock, which were rich with iron and clay. To be exact, they estimate that 10 billion bacterial cells live per cubic centimeter in these communities. (Bacteria known to live in mud along the seafloor pales in comparison, at 100 cells per cubic centimeter.)  <br><br>The researchers believe the iron content in the clay found deep below the ocean floor supports the growth of such large bacterial communities. The study published in the journal Communications Biology. <br><br>\"I thought it was a dream, seeing such rich microbial life in rocks,\" Suzuki said, \"I am now almost over-expecting that I can find life on Mars. If not, it must be that life relies on some other process that Mars does not have, like plate tectonics.\" <br><br>From the ocean floor to Mars <br><br>The cracks form when the lava cools, creating narrow spaces less than one millimeter across. Millions of years of residue and buildup fill them with mineral-infused clay. Then, bacteria find a nice home in them and settle in.  <br><br>\"These cracks are a very friendly place for life. Clay minerals are like a magic material on Earth; if you can find clay minerals, you can almost always find microbes living in them,\" Suzuki said. <br><br>The bacteria Suzuki and his colleagues found is similar to how our cells make energy, a process that relies on organic nutrients in oxygen. Instead of the resources humans get from Earth's surface, they get what they need from the clay minerals.  <br><br>Clay is something that NASA's Curiosity rover has explored quite a bit on Mars.   <br><br>Since Curiosity landed in 2012, it's been exploring Gale Crater, a vast and dry ancient lake bed with a 16,404-foot mountain -- Mount Sharp -- at its center. <br><br>Streams and lakes likely filled Gale Crater billions of years ago, which is why NASA landed the rover there in 2012. Scientists want to know if ancient Mars once supported microbial life.  <br><br>Mars, like Earth, also has a basaltic crust that formed four billion years ago. And in recent years, subsurface water and methane have been detected on the Red Planet.  <br><br>Curiosity has observed and drilled samples of rocks rich in clay from the lake bed.  <br><br>The clay minerals present in those rocks on the Martian surface could be similar to those in the ocean rock cracks.  <br><br>\"Minerals are like a fingerprint for what conditions were present when the clay formed. Neutral to slightly alkaline levels, low temperature, moderate salinity, iron-rich environment, basalt rock -- all of these conditions are shared between the deep ocean and the surface of Mars,\" said Suzuki. <br><br>His team is collaborating with researchers at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, to come up with a plan for examining and analyzing rock samples that will one day be returned from Mars.  <br><br>A 3D X-ray could help them peek inside the samples and search for cracks filled with minerals -- and maybe find evidence of life. <br><br>\"This discovery of life where no one expected it in solid rock below the seafloor may be changing the game for the search for life in space,\" said Suzuki. <br><br>Studying the ocean floor <br><br>But the quest for bacteria deep beneath the ocean floor is a tricky one. <br><br>\"Honestly, it was a very unexpected discovery. I was very lucky, because I almost gave up,\" said Suzuki. <br><br>The samples were collected in 2010 during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, an international marine research program, which took researchers from Tahiti to New Zealand. It stopped at three locations along the way, using a 9.7-mile-long metal tube to reach the ocean floor and then drill 410 feet below it. Core samples were retrieved, including mud, sediment and solid rock.  <br><br>The samples were taken far from hydrothermal vents to prevent contamination, in case the bacteria was carried from one of them to the rocks, and the rocks were sterilized when they were brought up. <br><br>Chipping away and grinding the rock didn't yield any results.  <br><br>Suzuki, inspired by the thin slices of tissue samples that pathologists use to diagnose diseases, coated the rocks in epoxy to maintain the rock shape, then sliced thin layers. He washed the thin pieces with dye that would stain any DNA present.  <br><br>Beneath his microscope, he saw green bacterial cells, surrounded by orange clay and black rock. Suzuki was able to conduct whole genome DNA analysis and identify what was living inside the cracks.  <br><br>He found evidence of life. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "123", "title": "Scientists uncover a 60,000-year-old forest underwater and think its preserved trees may help pioneer new medicines"}, {"id": "89", "title": "Long-term spaceflight could permanently increase astronaut brain volume, study says"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "164", "title": "Meteorites reveal that Martian water came from different sources"}]}, "155": {"title": "James Webb Space Telescope tests its giant mirror ahead of 2021 launch", "content": "When it launches in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope will be the premier observatory of the next decade, according to NASA. <br><br>And in March, despite the threat of shutdowns due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the infrared telescope passed another milestone test on the path to launch. <br><br>The telescope comes equipped with a mirror that can extend 21 feet and 4 inches -- a massive length that will allow the mirror to collect more light from the objects it observes once the telescope is in space. The more light the mirror can collect, the more details the telescope can observe. <br><br>It's the largest mirror NASA has ever built, the agency said, but its size created a unique problem. The mirror was so large that it couldn't fit inside a rocket. So they designed the telescope as a series of moving parts that can fold origami-style and fit inside a 16-foot space for launch.  <br><br>During the recent mirror deployment test, the mission team was able to see the large mirror completely unfurled -- the same way it will be in space. The test took place in the cleanroom at Northrop Grumman Space Systems in California. The company has a contract with NASA for multiple missions. <br><br>In the test, the spacecraft successfully responded to commands to extend the mirror to its complete size. <br><br>It's one of a series of tests on a long list that will need to be checked off before the space telescope is packed up and shipped to French Guiana, where the 2021 launch will take place.  <br><br>\"Deploying both wings of the telescope while part of the fully assembled observatory is another significant milestone showing Webb will deploy properly in space. This is a great achievement and an inspiring image for the entire team,\" said Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. <br><br>The coronavirus pandemic will likely affect future testing for the space telescope.  <br><br>Northrop Grumman's team has reduced their onsite personnel until sometime in April. After the Deployable Tower Assembly, another crucial component of the telescope, is set up, the project will shut down as NASA assesses when and how to resume testing and if conditions are safe for personnel.  <br><br>The Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) is 10 feet long and will act as a support for the telescope and spacecraft.  <br><br>What will the space telescope do? <br><br>The telescope will answer questions about our solar system, study exoplanets in new ways and peer deeper into the universe than we've ever been able to.  <br><br>The telescope was named for former NASA administrator James Webb, who ran the agency during the Space Race from February 1961 to October 1968. NASA officials said that while Webb is linked to the Apollo program, he also supported the agency's balance of human space flight and science.  <br><br>Each telescope builds on the knowledge gained from the previous one. In the case of James Webb, its mirror is 50 times larger than previous space telescopes -- like the recently retired Spitzer Space Telescope -- and it can observe even deeper into the universe.  <br><br>Spitzer, as well as NASA's ongoing planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, have helped scientists establish targets for follow-up by Webb, including some of Spitzer's \"greatest hits.\" <br><br>For example, in February 2017 astronomers announced their discovery of seven Earth-size planets orbiting a star 40 light-years from Earth. With Spitzer's help, the seven exoplanets were all found in tight formation around an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1.  <br><br>The planets all bear the TRAPPIST name -- which the researchers borrowed from their favorite beer.  <br><br>Some of the planned targets for Webb include TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1e, which could support liquid water on their surfaces. Finding water could suggest the potential for life as well. Another planned target for early in the mission is WASP-18b, a blazing hot Jupiter with an atmosphere, according to NASA.   <br><br>Webb is also well-equipped to shed light on the mysteries of planet formation. Building off Spitzer's work studying brown dwarfs -- objects that are too large to be planets but too small to be stars -- Webb can take a closer look at their cloud properties. <br><br>Spitzer was known for looking deep into the universe, studying galaxies that formed in the early days of the Big Bang. Webb is more sensitive, so it will be able to peer back even further.  <br><br>\"We'll be able to see some of the earliest galaxies to form in the universe that we've never seen before,\" said Amber Straughn, deputy project scientist for James Webb Space Telescope Science Communications.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

And the astronauts may build their base using something readily available: their urine. <br><br>As part of NASA's Artemis program, the first woman and next man on the moon will be landing at the lunar South Pole. It's a place with fluctuating temperatures that will require astronauts to \"learn how to live and operate on the surface of another celestial body,\" according to the agency.  <br><br>Unfortunately, the astronauts can't just land a habitat on the lunar surface and set up shop. Instead, they'll have to build a safe habitat to protect them from radiation, extreme temperature swings --  ranging from negative nine degrees Fahrenheit to negative 313 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 22 degrees Celsius to negative 191 degrees Celsius) -- and impacts by micrometeorites.  <br><br>Another goal of the Artemis program is for astronauts to find and use water on the moon, along with other resources at their disposal on or beneath the surface to allow long-term exploration. Artemis is the sustainable way of returning to the moon \"for good,\" said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. Unlike the Apollo program, this suggests a sustained presence on and around the moon. <br><br>Transporting materials to the moon is expensive -- flying about one pound of material from Earth to the moon can cost $10,000, according to previous study. This is why so many things designed from space travel are lightweight.  <br><br>So materials found on the moon, or those that the astronauts would already have with them, are key to the agency's sustainable approach. Previous studies of possible building material for lunar bases relied on materials that would have to be brought to the moon. <br><br>As part of a new study, researchers investigated what would happen if moon dust, known as regolith, was mixed with a component of human urine called urea to create a kind of concrete that can be 3D-printed to build a structure fit for human habitation. The study published last week in the Journal of Cleaner Production.  <br><br>\"To make the geopolymer concrete that will be used on the moon, the idea is to use what is there: regolith, or loose material from the moon's surface and the water from the ice present in some areas,\" said Ram\u00f3n Pamies, study author and a professor at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena in Spain. <br><br>But the researchers wanted to limit the amount of water used, since that will be needed for the astronauts and life support systems. <br><br>\"With this study we have seen that a waste product, such as the urine of the personnel who occupy the moon bases, could also be used,\" he said. \"The two main components of this body fluid are water and urea, a molecule that allows the hydrogen bonds to be broken and, therefore, reduces the viscosities [thickness] of many aqueous mixtures.\" <br><br>The researchers decided to test if urea could be used as a plasticizer in the concrete, which can soften the mixture to make it more pliable before the concrete hardens.  <br><br>For the test, a material similar to regolith, developed by the European Space Agency, was combined with urea and made into cylinders using a 3D printer.  <br><br>Other common plasticizers, like naphthalene and polycarboxylate, were also mixed with regolith and printed in the same way for comparison.  <br><br>After printing, the samples were tested to see if they could handle weight loads, including one just over two pounds and another closer to 25 pounds.  <br><br>The sample cylinders made with urea and naphthalene could hold the heavy weights and retain a mostly stable shape.

Researchers may have found a large clue in tiny slices from Martian meteorites that fell to Earth, according to a new study.  <br><br>Mars was likely a warm, wet planet billions of years ago before its atmosphere was slowly stripped down and whisked out into space -- leaving behind the thin atmosphere and frozen desert planet we know today. <br><br>But how did the water get to Mars in the first place? To understand that, researchers have to look at the layers of Mars. Like any planet, it has a core, mantle, crust and atmosphere.  <br><br>Fortuitously, Martian meteorites contain samples of the planet's crust. The crust is also where the largest reservoir is estimated to be on Mars, containing 35% of the total estimated water beneath the surface.  <br><br>The two well-known meteorites are known as Black Beauty and Allan Hills, and researchers studied thin slices of them to look into Mars' past, including how the planet formed and when water entered into the equation.  <br><br>Their study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. <br><br>The Black Beauty meteorite, which is estimated to be two million years old, formed and broke off of the planet when a massive impact hit Mars and laminated pieces of Martian crust together. This effectively also captured material from different points in the Martian timeline.  <br><br>\"This allowed us to form an idea of what Mars' crust looked like over several billions of years,\" said Jessica Barnes, study author and assistant professor of planetary sciences in the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. <br><br>When looking at the two meteorites, the researchers conducted a chemical analysis seeking out two types of hydrogen isotopes. Isotopes are the atoms that make up chemical elements. <br><br>They were specifically looking for \"light hydrogen\" and \"heavy hydrogen,\" because the ratio of these two isotopes can be used to understand the origin of water traces found in rocks. <br><br>For example, on Earth, scientists can study rocks and determine a similar ratio of hydrogen isotopes in all of them that translates to ocean water.  <br><br>But those values differ wildly in Martian meteorites, and none of them have been similar, the researchers said.  <br><br>The Black Beauty and Allan Hills meteorites suggested two different sources of water on Mars, based on their isotopes. <br><br>\"These two different sources of water in Mars' interior might be telling us something about the kinds of objects that were available to coalesce into the inner, rocky planets,\" Barnes said. \"This context is also important for understanding the past habitability and astrobiology of Mars.\" <br><br>So how does that happen? It's all about the ingredients that made Mars in the first place.  <br><br>Planetesimals were the building blocks of the planets that form our solar system today. They're made up of bits of gas and dust leftover from the formation of our sun. Over time, they grew in size and collided with one another, forming planets. <br><br>In the case of Mars, two different planetesimals with very different water content could have collided and never fully mixed, the researchers said.  <br><br>This is very different than the previous theory about the formation of Mars, which suggested it was more like Earth. That theory stemmed from another Martian meteorite, but this one came from the planet's mantle. The mantle is the rocky subsurface layer between the core and crust.  <br><br>\"The prevailing hypothesis before we started this work was that the interior of Mars was more Earth-like,\" Barnes said. \"So the variability in hydrogen isotope ratios within Martian samples was due to either terrestrial contamination or atmospheric implantation as it made its way off Mars.\" <br><br>Earth had a global magma ocean that helped create its core and atmosphere billions of years ago, as well as the plate tectonics that shaped the continents. Now, researchers believe that Mars formed differently than Earth. <br><br>The meteorites, combined with other previous data about Mars, including observations by the Curiosity rover, revealed three things.  <br><br>In the Martian meteorites, the crust remained much the same over time. The isotopes suggested the atmospheric changes they knew happened over time on Mars. And the crust samples were wildly different from the mantle below it. <br><br>\"Martian meteorites basically plot all over the place, and so trying to figure out what these samples are actually telling us about water in the mantle of Mars has historically been a challenge,\" Barnes said. \"The fact that our data for the crust was so different prompted us to go back through the scientific literature and scrutinize the data.\" <br><br>During that analysis, the researchers discovered two different types of Martian volcanic rocks called shergottites. Some were enriched, and some were depleted, meaning they contained evidence of water bearing different hydrogen isotopes. <br><br>Together, they match the strange story told by the Martian meteorites and Mars' different water sources. <br><br>\"It turns out that if you mix different proportions of hydrogen from these two kinds of shergottites, you can get the crustal value,\" Barnes said. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "32", "title": "Between 'Blade Runner' and utopia: Where we're headed 50 years after the first Earth Day"}, {"id": "123", "title": "Scientists uncover a 60,000-year-old forest underwater and think its preserved trees may help pioneer new medicines"}, {"id": "46", "title": "Tectonic plates helped early Earth evolve 3.2 billion years ago, and that shaped how life developed"}, {"id": "119", "title": "New fossil named after 'Lord of the Rings' character is related to mysterious reptiles"}, {"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}]}, "167": {"title": "Simona Halep's lockdown life: military on the streets, slower pace at home", "content": "While soldiers are patrolling the streets of Bucharest, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep has been adjusting to a new, different pace of life. <br><br>Romania, an eastern European country of 21 million, has been in a state of emergency since March 16 to slow the spread of the coronavirus. <br><br>Everyone over the age of 65 has to stay at home while the rest of the country is only allowed to leave home for essential shopping or work, provided they carry a letter from their employers.

At least 44 attacks against medical personnel have been registered across the country since mid-March, according to data provided to CNN by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination.  <br><br>  <br><br>The types of attacks vary but include nurses and doctors being struck in the face and scalding liquid thrown onto their bodies. <br><br>  <br><br>Authorities say the attacks are likely motivated by rumors that medical personnel are responsible for spreading the virus throughout Mexico. Several doctors and nurses told CNN they have been harassed on their social media accounts with accusations of spreading the disease. <br><br>  <br><br>\"These attacks show the lack of education, culture, as well as the ignorance of people,\" said Dr. Patricia Maldonado, a doctor who works at a hospital designated to treat Covid-19 patients in Guadalajara.  <br><br>  <br><br>As of Wednesday, Mexico had confirmed 10,544 cases of coronavirus infection and nearly 1,000 deaths, according to government data. <br><br>  <br><br>\"It is deeply outrageous that medical personnel are being attacked,\" said Deputy Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, the official leading Mexico's coronavirus response. \"It's alarming that there are people channeling very basic emotions like fear and anger toward the personnel that protect them.\" <br><br>  <br><br>Fabiana Maribel Zepeda Arias, the head of nursing for Mexico's public health system, told reporters this week that -- given the precautions healthcare workers take when treating Covid-19 patients -- it was ignorant to suggest they could be at fault for Mexico's rising toll.  <br><br>  <br><br>\"It hurts to talk about this,\" she said at a Monday press conference, her eyes welling with tears.  \"We are also people, we also have families, and we're leaving them behind to work in the hospitals.\" <br><br>  <br><br>'We're afraid for our lives' <br><br>  <br><br>Ligia Kantun, a nurse with more than 40 years of experience in the eastern state of Yucat\u00e1n, told CNN she was in a convenience store parking lot when she heard someone shout: \"Infected!\" <br><br>  <br><br>Seconds later, she felt searing liquid on her back, what turned out to be hot coffee. <br><br>  <br><br>\"The damage was more mental than physical,\" she told CNN. \"[My colleagues and I] are scared for our lives but we have to go to work because we have to save people.\" <br><br>  <br><br>CNN spoke with 10 medical personnel across Mexico who have either been attacked or have a colleague who was targeted. The incidents are relatively isolated for a country of nearly 130 million people, with far more examples of people publicly showing support for health care workers. Nevertheless, every health care worker that spoke to CNN said they feared for their personal safety.  <br><br>  <br><br>Dr. Maldonado told CNN that hospital managers made it mandatory not to wear medical scrubs in public. So workers commute in street clothes and change only once safely inside. <br><br>  <br><br>\"It makes me mad that there is zero empathy and we are the ones on the front lines,\"  she said.  \"And they don't even know it, but we will be the ones taking care of them or their families.\" <br><br>  <br><br>Beyond physical attacks, less violent forms of discrimination are happening, with several healthcare workers telling CNN their own neighbors have shunned them. <br><br>  <br><br>Guadalupe Galicia, a 30-year-old nurse, was working in a Mexico City hospital when she learned in mid-March she'd contracted the virus.  <br><br>  <br><br>She isolated at home and posted about her health on Facebook. But rather than support her, neighbors she'd known for years started demanding she leave, threatening her family with violence. They wanted her family to get hospitalized, thinking everyone was infected when it was only Galicia who was sick. <br><br>  <br><br>\"You're already feeling bad, unable to breathe at times, and then having people come and threaten you,\" she said in frustration. Galicia has since recovered from the virus. \"I've tested negative now and people still scream at me for being in the street.\" <br><br>  <br><br>Melody Rodriguez, 25, had recently finished a shift at the hospital in the western coastal town of San Francisco in Nayarit state where she works, about 15 minutes from her hometown. <br><br>  <br><br>When she returned home with a colleague, local residents had set up a makeshift roadblock to keep her and others from entering her own town. Cell phone video streamed live on Facebook and seen by CNN showed the obstruction and people saying that she could infect everyone. <br><br>  <br><br>\"The town is angry and worried, mostly worried about everything,\" a heavyset man behind a face mask says to the nurses. Off camera, another male voice says that if they enter the town, they'll have to stay there. <br><br>  <br><br>Rodriguez is now staying at a friend's house near her hospital. <br><br>  <br><br>Erik Hernandez, a 37-year-old nurse from Mexico City took off his scrubs when he got home from a recent shift and immediately washed them, determined to follow safety protocols.  <br><br>  <br><br>He laid them outside to dry overnight.  When he went to get the clothes in the morning, they'd been covered in bleach, completely ruined. <br><br>  <br><br>'Just let us do our jobs' <br><br>  <br><br>All 10 doctors and nurses told CNN they take pride in their work and had signed up to be on the front lines of any pandemic. What they didn't count on was the reaction of those they'd pledged to help. <br><br>  <br><br>\"It's unjust because we see the support for medical staff in other countries,\" said Graciela Monta\u00f1o, a nurse who's worked in Mexico City for decades.  \"In Spain, they applaud [for healthcare workers] and they are loved, and here we are mistreated and violently abused.\" <br><br>  <br><br>Dr. Torres, the ear, nose and throat specialist who was attacked with bleach, says she now goes to her job far more wary of her surroundings.  <br><br>  <br><br>For the Mexican public, she has a simple plea: \"We don't need to be clapped for and no one needs to give us flowers,\" she said.  \"Just let us do our jobs without the fear of being attacked.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "212", "title": "Meet the ICU nurse who silently stood in protest at a rally to reopen Arizona"}, {"id": "118", "title": "How reporters are covering the biggest story of their careers"}, {"id": "106", "title": "10 million students in China are facing the toughest exam of their lives in a pandemic"}, {"id": "74", "title": "Doctors, nurses and scientists -- not politicians -- should be leading coronavirus briefings"}, {"id": "167", "title": "Simona Halep's lockdown life: military on the streets, slower pace at home"}]}, "189": {"title": "After the dinosaurs went extinct, some birds shrank in body size and kept big brains", "content": "Being called a \"bird brain\" may be closer to a compliment than an insult.  <br><br>That's because new research suggests that some birds evolved over time to have smaller bodies and maintain large brains. <br><br>Researchers studied the endocasts of skulls belonging to hundreds of dinosaurs and extinct birds.  <br><br>They used CT scans of the animals' ancient skulls to create endocasts, which act like an imprint of the brain in the skull, reflecting brain sizes (since brains don't fossilize). Then, they compared the brain sizes with brain measurements of modern birds in a large data set.  <br><br>The brain measurements were analyzed along with body size to compare the scale of brain size to body size.  <br><br>Together, the evolutionary biologists and paleontologists were able to show the timeline for bird brain evolution. The study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.  <br><br>Before the mass extinction event that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the researchers discovered that birds and large dinosaurs had brains that were very similar in size.  <br><br>But some birds went through what the researchers refer to as a \"scaling\" event after the dinosaurs went extinct.  <br><br>Birds were some of the first animals to recover and repopulate the empty landscape after the dinosaurs disappeared. They diversified and evolved in this setting, and some of the birds that started out larger in size experienced what's called \"a scaling down.\" Their bodies shrank in size, but they kept the big brains of their larger ancestors. <br><br>\"Our paper emphasizes that the mass extinction really altered the course of avian brain evolution,\" said Daniel Ksepka, lead study author and curator of science at the Bruce Museum, in an email to CNN.  <br><br>\"There were profound changes in brain-body scaling in the immediate aftermath of the extinction, and these may have played an important role in modern birds surviving and going on to radiate into the 10,000+ species we have today.\" <br><br>The changes appeared to occur very rapidly after the asteroid impact that caused the dinosaur extinction, Ksepka said. They found at least seven brain-body scaling events in birds right after the mass extinction. <br><br>Before the mass extinction event, the similarities between dinosaur and bird brains were almost indistinguishable. <br><br>\"There is no clear line between the brains of advanced dinosaurs and primitive birds,\" said Amy Balanoff, study co-author and assistant research professor in Johns Hopkins University's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, in a statement.  <br><br>\"Birds like emus and pigeons have the same brain sizes you would expect for a theropod dinosaur of the same body size, and in fact some species like moa have smaller-than-expected brains.\" <br><br>The mass extinction event likely acted as a trigger for these changes. These birds had to evolve to survive. <br><br>\"In the aftermath of the asteroid impact, it would have been intensely challenging to survive,\" Ksepka said. \"Larger-brained animals tend to have more flexibility in adapting to changing environments.  <br><br>\"Likewise, smaller-bodied animals seem to have had a better chance of surviving in the immediate aftermath since they need less food. So, the altered landscape may have triggered the rapid evolution of new brain-body scaling patterns by favoring both larger brains and smaller bodies.\" <br><br>The largest evolutionary brain leap is evident in modern birds like parrots and corvids, the group that includes crows, ravens and other related birds. And their brains are quite large when compared with their body size, although crows and parrots are relatively large birds. Crows are \"particularly turbo-charged\" when it comes to brain capacity, Ksepka said. <br><br>It can explain why they're able to recognize and remember human faces, use tools and even speak, like parrots do. In fact, crows and ravens seem to parallel our own evolutionary history as well as some behaviors we associate with being human, Ksepka said.  <br><br>\"Like our hominin [ancient human ancestor] lineage, these birds evolved to have both larger brains and larger bodies,\" Ksepka said. \"Brain size expanded faster than body size, leading to big, smart birds. Just like we ended up being big, (sometimes) smart primates.\" <br><br>\"Crows are really off the charts - they outpaced all other birds,\" said Adam Smith, study co-author and curator of the Bob Campbell Geology Museum at Clemson University, in a statement. \"Our results suggest that calling someone 'bird-brained' is actually quite a compliment!\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "89", "title": "Long-term spaceflight could permanently increase astronaut brain volume, study says"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

The pollutant, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks. <br><br>Seven out of the 10 cities studied, including New Delhi, Seoul, Wuhan and Mumbai, saw significant improvements in air quality. Those with historically higher levels of PM2.5 pollution witnessed the most substantial drops in pollution. <br><br>Analysts chose the three-week timeframe to reflect either the period with the strictest lockdowns, or -- during longer lockdown periods such as in Wuhan -- to coincide with the peak number of daily reported coronavirus cases. <br><br>The report was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which this year is focused on climate action.  <br><br>Air pollution is already a global public health crisis, as it kills seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Reducing global heat-trapping emissions is the best way to clean up our skies and prevent avoidable pollution-related deaths, scientists say. <br><br>The report's authors say that while they do expect air pollution to rise again when economies restart after coronavirus, \"out of these extraordinary circumstances, we can see how changes in our society's activities can have a momentous impact on our environment and the air we breathe,\" said IQAir's marketing specialist Kelsey Duska. <br><br>Cleaner air around the world <br><br>The Indian capital New Delhi -- which frequently tops the world's most polluted city lists -- saw a 60% reduction in PM2.5 levels from March 23 to April 13 from the same period in 2019.  <br><br>Both New Delhi and the country's commercial center Mumbai experienced their best March air quality on record in 2020. <br><br>During the initial three-week lockdown period, the number of hours rated as \"unhealthy\" in New Delhi dropped from 68% in 2019 to 17% in 2020. <br><br>On March 25, India placed its entire 1.3 billion population into lockdown, closing factories, markets, shops, places of worship and suspending most public transport services. The world's largest lockdown was then extended to May 3.  <br><br>India is one of the world's most-polluted countries and an average resident is exposed to air pollution that exceeds the World Health Organization's target for annual PM2.5 exposure by more than 500%.  <br><br>Meanwhile, the South Korean capital Seoul saw a 54% drop in PM2.5 levels from February 26 to March 18 from the previous year.  <br><br>South Korea's air quality ranks among the worst of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, with some of the highest levels of particulate matter pollution. Last year in March, the government declared air pollution a \"social disaster.\"  <br><br>In February, South Korea had one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks outside mainland China but aggressive testing and contact tracing methods have brought cases there under control.  <br><br>And the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the deadly virus was first identified, saw a 44% reduction in air pollution levels from February 26 to March 18 from the same period last year.  <br><br>The city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province was the first city to impose a complete shutdown after Chinese authorities struggled to contain the spread of the coronavirus -- an unprecedented move at the time.   <br><br>After 75 days those restrictions began to be lifted on April 8 -- a milestone in China's fight against Covid-19 as the country reported nearly zero new local infections. <br><br>Over the course of Wuhan's 10-week lockdown, the city experienced its cleanest air quality on record for the months of February and March. The average concentration of PM2.5 plunged from 63.2 and 43.9 micrograms per cubic meter in February and March 2019 respectively, to 36.8 and 32.9 in the same months this year. The World Health Organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe. <br><br>Elsewhere, other major cities experienced cleaner air. Los Angeles saw its longest stretch of clean air on record, over 18 days from March 7 to 28. PM2.5 concentration levels were down by 31% from the same time last year, and down 51% from the average of the previous four years. <br><br>And in Europe, London and Madrid both experienced reductions in their PM2.5 compared to 2019 during their lockdown periods.  <br><br>Calls to pursue green deals <br><br>While suddenly closing all factories and banning cars from roads is not a sustainable solution tackle climate change, the IQAir researchers said there are ways to preserve healthier air conditions.  <br><br>These include supporting green deals in government stimulus packages, shifting towards sustainable sources of energy for power generation, limiting individual's purchases to primarily essential goods, opting for cleaner modes of transportation -- including walking and cycling -- and encouraging a shared economy of goods, according to Duska. <br><br>\"In our recovery from the pandemic, it's important that we strive to preserve the cleaner environment, which protects our health from another invisible killer, air pollution,\" she said.  <br><br>\"We hope that the urgency in tackling this global pandemic may be matched in addressing air pollution.\" <br><br>A previous version of this story included Rome among cities that had improved PM2.5 levels.

Her sudden death was a shock to family members. They all believed it was a heart attack, Cabello said.   <br><br>California's Santa Clara County had announced Tuesday that tissue samples confirmed two people who had died in early February tested positive for coronavirus -- well before the United States' previously understood first coronavirus-related death on February 29 in Washington state. <br><br>One victim was a 57-year-old woman who died on February 6, and the other was a 67-year-old man who died on February 17, the county said. The county did not name the woman, but Cabello told the Los Angeles Times and CNN that she was Dowd, his sister.  <br><br>Neither patient had a recent history of travel that would have exposed them to the virus, Santa Clara County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Sara Cody said in a Wednesday news conference, and officials are presuming both cases represent community transmission.   <br><br>'She had flu-like symptoms'  <br><br>Before Dowd was found dead February 6, \"she had flu-like symptoms for a few days, then appeared to recover,\" the Los Angeles Times reported.    <br><br>Five days before she died, Dowd called her brother to tell him she couldn't make it to a family visit in Stockton, California.  <br><br>\"She wasn't feeling well, which was very unusual for her,\" Cabello said. \"I remember her specifically saying 'I'm not feeling well,'\" he added.   <br><br>She also had canceled plans to go a weekend funeral, the Los Angeles Times reported. <br><br>Dowd started working from home as her condition improved and had been in touch with a colleague around 8 a.m. on the day of her death. She was found dead about two hours later, according to the Los Angeles Times.  <br><br>A traveler and 'everybody's rock' <br><br>Dowd was a frequent world traveler, her brother said. <br><br>She had planned to travel to China later this year and went abroad \"multiple times a year to different global locations,\" a family member told the Los Angeles Times. Dowd had a history of foreign travel, as did her coworkers at Lam Research, the newspaper also reported.  <br><br>Dowd was \"hardworking, loyal, and caring,\" Cabello told the Los Angeles Times.  <br><br>\"She was the energy person in her large network of friends,\" her brother said. \"She was everybody's rock.\"  <br><br>In a tribute wall set up for Patricia Dowd by the Cusimano Family Colonial Mortuary, a coworker wrote, \"I'll always remember the kindness and generosity of her spirit. She was genuinely caring and had an amazing energy.\"  <br><br>As more deaths are investigated, more positives may come <br><br>Neither of the two victims who died in February had been tested for the virus at the time of their deaths because testing capacity was limited, Santa Clara County officials said Tuesday in a news release. <br><br>Tests were only available through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were restricted to people who had a known travel history and showed certain symptoms.  <br><br>Both of the victims who passed away in February had flu-like symptoms before dying, county officials said.  <br><br>\"Because there was continued suspicion by the medical examiner that these deaths were caused by Covid-19, the medical examiner sent autopsy tissue to the CDC for definitive testing,\" the coroner's office said in a statement. <br><br>As the county investigates more deaths, it's likely that more will be tied to the virus, officials said.

The town is one of two communities taking part in the new study launched by the University of California, San Francisco with the aim of gaining a more complete understanding of how the virus invisibly spread during the initial shortfall of comprehensive nationwide testing. <br><br>Bolinas, with a population of fewer than 2,000 people, sits idyllically on the Pacific Ocean in rural Marin County, just north of San Francisco. Starting this past Monday, residents of this picturesque town have four days to visit a pop-up testing site to receive nasal swabs for Covid-19 infection, as well as submit for a finger prick to test for antibodies.  <br><br>Five days later, beginning on April 25, and in an entirely different populous, nearly 6,000 residents of a section of the densely inhabited Mission District in San Francisco will have four days of their own in which to take advantage of the testing. <br><br>More than 700 residents were tested across the first two days in Bolinas, with 302 people on Monday and another 416 on Tuesday, according to venture capitalist Jyri Engestrom, one of those responsible for making the project a reality.   <br><br>Along with several wealthy tech entrepreneurs, including Mark Pincus -- the founder of video game maker Zynga who chipped in the first $100,000 -- a GoFundMe page was launched to help raise the approximately $400,000 needed for the operation.  <br><br>Engestrom notes that 93% of the more than 150 donors on GoFundMe donated less than $5,000, and said they have raised around $300,000 to date. <br><br>The study is led by a team of researchers from the UCSF Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. <br><br>\"All our public health decisions, including when it will be possible to relax regional and statewide shelter-in-place orders, are driven by rough assumptions about how this virus behaves based on very limited data,\" said Bryan Greenhouse, an associate professor of medicine at UCSF and a CZ Biohub Investigator. <br><br>\"Studying in detail how the virus has spread in these two distinctive communities will give us crucial data points that we can extrapolate to better predict how to control the virus in similar communities nationwide,\" Greenhouse said. <br><br>One of the keys to the study may be how many people ultimately submit to the voluntary testing, but there is hope among the study's organizers that there will be ample demand. Greenhouse said Thursday they had \"an entire community immobilized around the testing.\" <br><br>\"It's going fantastic,\" Greenhouse told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"I'm just blown away with how amazing everyone has been.\" <br><br>The team hopes to have all results on the virus tests back for the entire community by next week, Greenhouse said. <br><br>The study was proposed in Bolinas as the result of local, grassroots efforts and inspired by earlier efforts in the Italian city of Vo, which tested nearly its entire community and dramatically reduced new coronavirus infections. <br><br>Last month, an effort by San Miguel County in southwestern Colorado had sought to be the first to sample an entire county in the United States, but the effort was later put on hold when troubles arose with the lab conducting the tests.  <br><br>The county, peppered with 14,000 foot plus peaks, had partnered with United Biomedical, Inc. to conduct the testing, and intended to begin with the more than 7,000 residents in the famed ski town of Telluride, before ultimately delaying the effort. <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "61", "title": "The missing link in the study of black holes?

Charlie Baker during his daily coronavirus updates, told CNN in an email interview. <br><br>\"I have heard again and again about how community members didn't realize the severity of this pandemic until they watched us at work and adjusted their plans accordingly.\" <br><br>Many nations -- including Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia -- have also used interpreters during televised news conferences with top public officials. <br><br>ASL interpreters vs. closed captioning <br><br>While the White House doesn't currently use an interpreter during its coronavirus briefings, it does include closed captioning -- which displays the audio portion of a video as words on a screen.  <br><br>The closed captioning is used in daily livestreams of the coronavirus task force updates, as well as on videos of past briefings uploaded to YouTube. <br><br>It's also legally required for broadcasters, cable networks and other programmers that play the briefings on air to include closed captioning both on TV and on web streams to make programming more accessible to viewers. <br><br>Some Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing certainly use closed captioning to stay informed.  <br><br>But, Dubler said based on feedback he's received, there are members of the deaf community who feel closed captioning can be inaccurate, difficult to follow or \"inaccessible.\" <br><br>With closed captioning, \"even if the accuracy rate is 100% (which it rarely is), there is still plenty of information missing or wrong,\" Greenlee echoed.  <br><br>Both Greenlee and Rupert said that conveying tone can also be lost in written captions, while an interpreter's facial expressions, sign choice and demeanor can add context and comfort to a message -- especially during a public health crisis. <br><br>\"Our interpretation strives to capture the genuine emotion of the governor when he reflects on those lives lost. This display of empathy that they now have access to makes many community members understand better the Governor's decisions that are having an enormous impact on their lives,\" Dubler told CNN. \"We absolutely cannot leave anybody behind in this work.\" <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

The wound required stitches at a local hospital, police said.  <br><br>CNN has previously noted that reports of attacks against Asian people and those appearing to be East Asian have intensified after the novel coronavirus outbreak began in China.  <br><br>The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force said it has investigated 11 cases in which Asian victims were targeted due to the coronavirus since the start of the outbreak. <br><br>In Los Angeles, a woman was berated by an irate passenger who singled her out on the subway, claiming Chinese people are putrid and responsible for all diseases.  <br><br>Tanny Jiraprapasuke, who is Thai American, said the man ranted for about 10 minutes and was specifically looking and gesturing at her.  <br><br>She started recording the tirade as the man lectured another passenger.  <br><br>\"Every disease has ever came (sic) from China, homie,\" the man said, adding \"everything comes from China because they're f****** disgusting.\" <br><br>Hate crimes remain at heightened levels <br><br>FBI Director Wray's letter to law enforcement this week follows an intelligence report obtained in March by ABC News warning of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans.  <br><br>\"The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease ... endangering Asian American communities,\" according to the FBI intelligence report obtained by ABC. \"The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations.\" <br><br>Late last year, the FBI, which tracks national crime trends and statistics, announced that the number of hate crime incidents reported to the agency by law enforcement in 2018 remained at the heightened levels they surged to in 2017.   <br><br>The statistics released in the annual Hate Crime Statistics report were a compilation of bias-motivated incidents submitted to the FBI by 16,039 law enforcement agencies. The latest report found that 7,120 hate crime incidents were reported by law enforcement agencies to the FBI in 2018, just 55 fewer than had been reported in 2017. Between 2016 and 2017, the FBI found a 17% increase in reported incidents. <br><br>In the letter to law enforcement this week from Wray, the bureau's chief told state and local officials around the country the FBI will continue to investigate potential hate crimes and other incidents associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.  <br><br>\"We'll stay focused on these kinds of investigations,\" Wray wrote, \"and we welcome any referrals your agency might have on similar incidents.\" <br><br>While not commenting on the letter obtained by CNN, a bureau spokesperson said, \"As part of the continuous dialogue with our law enforcement partners, the FBI routinely shares information about potential threats to better enable law enforcement to protect the communities they serve. We urge the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity to law enforcement.\"  <br><br>In addition to the FBI's recent concerns about the potential targeting of minorities associated with the spread of coronavirus, federal officials have also provided state and local counterparts with general warnings about potential violence by domestic terrorists.  <br><br>In an intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN ahead of the recent 25th anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned that domestic terrorists are likely to continue to target racial minorities, religious groups, law enforcement and government agencies.  <br><br>\"The mass shooting attacks and violent hate crimes perpetrated in the United States since January 2019 and the multiple disrupted plots thus far in 2020 underscore the continued threat,\" read the bulletin. <br><br>Potential for violence <br><br>While law enforcement works to stop potential threats, outside experts remain concerned about an apparent heightened state of racist and discriminatory attacks against minorities by those spewing hateful rhetoric during the coronavirus pandemic.  <br><br>In a study released this month by the Network Contagion Research Institute, an independent third party that tracks misinformation and hate across social media channels, researchers found the coronavirus pandemic has coincided with a surge in Sinophobic, or anti-Chinese, sentiments -- especially online. <br><br>The report, which surveyed discriminatory rhetoric posted in online forums popular with hate groups, noted that \"hateful communities may serve as sources of spread for disinformation and propaganda during politically volatile events for purposes of hate.\" <br><br>The study noted that one conspiracy theory researchers identified online suggested coronavirus is a bioweapon created by China's government and transmitted by Chinese people. <br><br>According to Alex Goldenberg, one of the study's authors, \"We are seeing instances where this Asian conspiracy is seeping into the mainstream, and an outgrowth of that could very well be violence.\"  <br><br>CNN's Geneva Sands, Jessie Yeung, Scottie Andrew, Joe Sutton, Taylor Romine, Holly Yan, Natasha Chen, Dushyant Naresh, Alice Yu, Shawn Nottingham and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.  <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "75", "title": "Beijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin"}, {"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

In three College Football Playoff games, Burrow threw for an absurd 1,305 yards, 16 touchdowns and zero interceptions while leading the Tigers to a National Championship over Clemson in the title game. <br><br>\"Enough talk,\" Burrow wrote in a tweet, which was a response to the Bengals' welcome tweet. \"Time to get to work.\" <br><br>This marks the first time in the common draft era that a Heisman Trophy winner was selected No. 1 overall in three consecutive drafts.  <br><br>The virtual draft replaced what was supposed to be an extravagant event planned along the Las Vegas strip, with thousands in attendance. The league was going to ferry players via boat to a stage on the Bellagio fountain.  <br><br>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, plans changed.  <br><br>Players, coaches, general managers, analysts and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell instead broadcast live from their homes. All 32 teams are also participating remotely. <br><br>With live sports canceled across the US, the virtual draft is as close to a live sporting event that sports-starved fans are able to watch.  <br><br>\"We're obviously staging this event in a much different way than we anticipated when we started,\" Goodell, who announced picks from his basement, said in an interview with ESPN before the draft. \"We're not in Las Vegas, unfortunately, but we're all in our homes and we're doing this remotely and we're doing it within regulations without any exceptions. <br><br>While Burrow was unable to shake Goodell's hand and walk across what was supposed to be an extravagant stage in Las Vegas, the quarterback still gets to fulfill his dream of making it to the NFL. <br><br>No. 2 pick <br><br>Chase Young is widely viewed as a \"can't-miss prospect.\" The edge rusher from Ohio State is explosive, powerful, and the type of talent that offensive coordinators will have nightmares trying to game plan against. <br><br>He also has a wide range of pass-rush moves that will leave offensive lineman grasping at air. <br><br>Young won the Bednarik Trophy in 2019, which is awarded to the best defensive player in college football. He was a dominant force in 2019 despite being suspended for two games. <br><br>In his final two seasons with the Buckeyes, he racked up 27 sacks, 35.5 tackles for a loss and eight forced fumbles. He also set Ohio State's single-season record for sacks with 16.5 in his final year with the team despite only playing in 12 games. <br><br>New York Giants play it safe <br><br>New York Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman's tenure has been riddled with questionable moves, and the team has holes to fill all over the roster. <br><br>Many experts expected the Giants to trade down and acquire more draft capital, but with no offers or deals, Gettleman selected offensive tackle Andrew Thomas out of Georgia. <br><br>This pick is a clear investment into protecting the team's last two top draft picks: running back Saquon Barkley and quarterback Daniel Jones. <br><br>Thomas is a powerful lineman and safe pick that should start from day one. <br><br>Tua Tagovailoa <br><br>The Miami Dolphins selected Tua Tagovailoa with the No. 5 overall pick. <br><br>There were a lot of questions over Tagovailoa's health after he sat out most of his final season at Alabama with a hip injury. <br><br>Tagovailoa proved to be a dynamic playmaker in college and has the makings of a star in the NFL. His accuracy, decision-making and pocket presence makes him one of the most exciting players in this year's draft. <br><br>As a true freshman, Tagovailoa replaced quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second half of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship and led Alabama to victory with a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.  <br><br>He followed up his MVP performance with a stellar sophomore season where he threw for 3,966 yards, 43 touchdowns and six interceptions. He led Alabama to another National Championship game appearance, where the team lost to Clemson. <br><br>Justin Herbert <br><br>Six picks in and three quarterbacks are already off the board. The Los Angeles Chargers selected Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert with its first-round pick. <br><br>Herbert has the arm, size and athleticism to excel at the next level. Playing the game's most important position, it's no surprise that Herbert was selected in the top 10. <br><br>After quarterback Philip Rivers left the team in the offseason, it was clear that the team needed to draft its quarterback of the future. While the team signed quarterback Tyrod Taylor in the offseason, he was likely just a stop-gap until they found someone to lead the Chargers into the next decade. <br><br>There's no need to rush Herbert, as they can sit him and let him develop behind Taylor until he proves ready to take over. <br><br>First wide receiver taken off the board <br><br>The 2020 draft class has been viewed as one of the best receiving draft classes in years, and it took 12 picks for the first wide receiver to be taken off the board. <br><br>However, the Oakland Raiders opted to go with speedster Henry Ruggs III instead of receivers CeeDee Lamb or Jerry Jeudy at No. 12. <br><br>Ruggs ran a scorching fast 4.27-second 40-yard dash, and he will enter the league as one of the fastest players in the league. His elite speed makes him a touchdown threat every time he steps on the field, but he needs to develop his route-running abilities to become a truly elite player at the next level. <br><br>CNN's Frank Pallotta and Jillian Martin contributed to this report. <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "190", "title": "What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 23"}, {"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.

She responded, \"Not as a treatment,\" before Trump asked her again to look into it.  <br><br>Later, Trump again directed Birx to look into the potential for sunlight to be a cure.  <br><br>\"I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't.\" <br><br>Facts First: As Birx told Trump directly, and as medical experts said after the briefing, sunlight isn't a potential treatment for coronavirus. This bizarre exchange is the latest example of Trump grasping for a quick fix for the pandemic, after he previously suggested it might \"go away\" in warm weather and that anti-malaria pills could be a \"game-changer.\"  <br><br>Immediately after the briefing, two doctors told CNN's Erin Burnett that Trump's comments did not make medical sense and warned against taking his suggestions seriously.  <br><br>\"Very little of what the President said as it pertains to disinfection or phototherapy makes any sense,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist at The George Washington University Hospital who advised the White House during President George W. Bush's tenure. \"Look, everyone wants a quick fix. And the President clearly wants a quick fix; we all do. But there are no quick fixes. We have to do this the right way; we have to do this with science.\"  <br><br>Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician who works at Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University, also batted down the President's suggestion and warned that trying it could cause sunburn, skin cancer or other dangerous consequences.  <br><br>\"Going out in the sun or exposing yourself to these high-intensity UV lamps is not going to protect you from Covid-19,\" she said on CNN. \"I don't want people to think that this is another miracle cure.\" <br><br>False denial on hydroxychloroquine  <br><br>At Thursday's briefing, Trump issued a false denial when asked why he has stopped his promotion of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that he embraces as a potential cure for coronavirus. <br><br>\"I haven't at all,\" the President said, before asking the reporter, \"Why do you say I have?\" <br><br>Facts First: Trump has significantly tamped down his rhetoric about the drug in the past week, compared with his comments in March, according to a CNN analysis.  <br><br>In March and early April, the President name-dropped hydroxychloroquine almost daily, and he mentioned it dozens of times at White House briefings, according to the CNN tally. He incorrectly implied it was safe to treat Covid-19, encouraged Americans to \"try it\" and said it might be the biggest breakthrough in modern medicine.  <br><br>\"What do you have to lose?\" he asked during a briefing in April. <br><br>But he hasn't mentioned the drug by name -- or touted its effectiveness -- in more than a week. <br><br>Trump stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine around the time that a series of studies came back with negative results. New research from Brazil, France and veterans' hospitals in the US indicate that the drug might not help patients with the coronavirus, and might even have deadly side effects. <br><br>For the second day in a row, the President also said he didn't see the study of US veterans' hospitals, even though he was asked about it both days and it has been covered heavily in the mainstream media.  <br><br>About the research into the drug, Trump said, \"We had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren't so good.\" It's true that there were some studies earlier this year with promising results for Covid-19. But public health experts said that much of that research was anecdotal, and the publisher of a study that Trump repeatedly cited now says there were serious flaws with the trial. <br><br>Joe Biden and debates  <br><br>Trump claimed that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is \"a guy who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid.\"  <br><br>Facts First: This is misleading. In late March, two weeks before Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary, Biden said he was focused on the pandemic crisis and did not think there should be another debate against Sanders, over whom he had an overwhelming delegate lead. But Biden has never said he does not want to debate Trump in particular, because of the virus or for any other reason. Rather, Biden has consistently expressed eagerness to debate Trump even if it is not in person -- saying at a fundraiser earlier on Thursday that \"I can hardly wait to debate Donald Trump. Are you kidding?\" <br><br>According to a pool report from Washington Post reporter Annie Linskey, Biden then added: \"Look, I'm ready to debate him. Zoom or Skype or Slack or Hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants.\"  <br><br>Biden made a similar comment in an interview on March 31, Bloomberg News reported: \"I'm ready to debate President Trump on Zoom or Skype anytime he wants.\"   <br><br>\"I can hardly wait to get him on a debate stage,\" Biden said on ABC's \"The View\" in February.  <br><br>\"Come on, Mr. President. I can hardly wait,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in early March.  <br><br> <br><br>", "related": [{"id": "86", "title": "California Gov.
